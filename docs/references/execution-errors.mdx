# Execution Errors

## Overview
A list of possible errors returned when executing canisters.

## Errors

### Method Not found
A canister was called with a method name not exported by that canister.

An example of this error is:
```
  Error from Canister xxx-xxx: Canister has no update method 'foobar'.
```

To fix this error, consider

1. Checking that the method name exacly matches the name exported by the callee.
1. Checking that the method type (update, query, etc...) is the same as the type of the exported method.
1. The canister code of the callee has not been modified to a version that depricates the method.

For further information on calling canisters see the [smart contract docs](../developer-docs/smart-contracts/call/overview) and the [IC spec](./ic-interface-spec#system-api-requests).
