# 1.3: Acquiring and using cycles

## Overview

If you recall from the previous module, [Internet Computer terminology](../level-0/02-ic-terms.md), cycles are used to measure the resources, such as memory, storage, and compute power, that are consumed by a canister. When a canister is deployed on the mainnet, cycles are consumed for every action that a canister performs.

To obtain cycles, the IC's utility token, ICP, can be converted into cycles and transferred into a canister to be used to pay for that canister's consumed resources. ICP can be converted to cycles using a conversion rate where the current price of ICP measured is in [XDR](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/glossary#xdr), and one trillion cycles corresponds to one XDR. 

Since cycles are not a currency and are only used to pay for a canister's consumed resources, developers can manage the distribution of cycles through a special canister called a **cycles wallet**. When a canister needs to use the cycles stored in the cycles wallet, the canister's operations are executed using the canister principal of the cycles wallet, rather than your user principal. 

For local canister execution, the SDK automatically creates a default cycles wallet in every project, and operations performed using cycles are done in the background. In a production environment with canisters deployed on the mainnet, canisters will need to have cycles explicitly registered and transferred into them. Production canisters will also require principals to be configured to act as **custodians**, which are principals that have permission to send and receive cycles for the canister. 

In this tutorial, we'll cover how to set up a cycles wallet and fill it with cycles to use. Then, in the next tutorial we'll deploy a canister to the mainnet using those cycles. 

## Prerequisites

Before you start, verify that you have set up your developer environment according to the instructions in [0.3: Developer environment setup](../level-0/03-dev-env.md).

## Setting up a cycles wallet

First, assure that `dfx` is running; if not, use the following command to start it:

```
dfx start --background
```

Next we will create a new user identity principal with the command:

```
dfx identity new DevJourney
```

Set this identity as the one to be used by `dfx` with the command:

```
dfx identity use DevJourney
```

## Acquiring cycles

Cycles can be obtained by converting ICP tokens into cycles. There are a few ways to obtain ICP tokens, such as:

- Purchasing ICP tokens directly through a crypto exchange. 
- Receiving ICP tokens as a reward for participating in the NNS governance.  
- Receiving a grant of ICP tokens through the DFINITY Foundation.
- Receiving ICP tokens in return for providing resources as a node provider. 

For new developers, a free cycles coupon can be obtained and redeemed for 20T free cycles that can be used to get started with dapp deployment. For this developer journey, we'll be obtaining and using that free cycles coupon. 

This coupon is good for new developers since it doesn't require that you transfer ICP tokens into cycles, and doesn't require a purchase of tokens to get started. 

First, navigate to the website <https://faucet.dfinity.org>. 

To obtain a coupon code to use the cycles faucet, you need to put in a written request for the coupon via the [DFINITY dev official Discord](https://discord.gg/jnjVVQaE2C) server.

Click on the **REQUEST CYCLES** button on the faucet web page to join the Discord server.

Once inside the Discord server, navigate into the `#cycles-faucet` channel. 

![Cycles-faucet](./_attachments/cycles-faucet.png)

In this channel, send a message. 

This message can be something along the lines of:

> Hello, I'd like to request a cycles coupon. Thank you.

After you send this message, a member of the DFINITY team will reach out to you through a Discord direct message. 

:::caution
Please ensure that your Discord settings are set to allow direct messages from other users.
:::

In the direct message from the DFINITY team member, there will be a survey. You must complete this survey. 

![Survey](_attachments/faucet_step_2.png)

In this survey, you will be asked for

Once completed, reply to the direct message to inform the team member that you've completed the survey. Then, they will send you the cycles coupon code.

Head back to the <https://faucet.dfinity.org> webpage. 

Now, click **NEXT STEP** to continue.

Now that you have a coupon code, enter your coupon code within the faucet UI.

![Enter Coupon](_attachments/faucet_step_3.png)

Click **NEXT STEP** to continue.

Return to your terminal window. If you closed the window in the process, run the following commands to start `dfx` and use your previously created identity:

```
dfx start --background
dfx identity use DevJourney
```

Then, redeem your coupon with the command:

```
dfx wallet --network ic redeem-faucet-coupon COUPON_CODE
```

Replace **COUPON_CODE** with the cycles coupon code sent to you by the DFINITY team member. 

Verify your cycles balance with the command:

```
dfx wallet --network ic balance
```

This should return an output showing 20T cycles in your wallet. 

To get the canister identifier of your new cycles wallet, run the command:

```
dfx identity --network ic get-wallet
```

The output of this command should resemble the following:

```
gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai
```

## Next steps

In this tutorial, we set up our identity and acquired free cycles from the cycles faucet. Now that we have cycles, we can deploy our first dapp on the IC mainnet.
