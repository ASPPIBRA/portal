# 4.4 NNS governance and staking

## Overview

When blockchain networks need to be upgraded, traditionally they use a method known as a 'hard fork', which involves substantial work and manual coordination. In comparison, the Internet Computer upgrades itself weekly, which can be seen on the [ICP dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/releases). 

Each upgrade made to the IC is first introduced as an NNS proposal. Then, users who stake ICP governance tokens can create a neuron, which provides them voting power within the NNS. 

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use the NNS dapp and how to stake ICP tokens into a neuron to receive NNS voting power. 

## What is the NNS?

The Network Nervous System (NNS) is the governing body of the Internet Computer. It is a decentralized autonomous organization that is hosted fully on-chain and is responsible for making protocol-level upgrades to the IC. The goal of the NNS is to allow the IC to be governed in a secure, open, and decentralized way. Therefore, it has complete control over the network. Some examples of upgrades made to the IC through the NNS are:

- Upgrade the protocol and software used by the network's node machines.

- Create new subnets.

- Split and divide subnets.

- Configure economic parameters that control how much users pay for their used resources.

When an NNS proposal is submitted, the network participants vote on whether to adopt the proposed changes to reject them. Voting is done via a liquid democracy, where ICP holders can stake ICP within a voting neuron in return for the ability to vote on proposals that change the IC. 

### Neurons

Neurons are similar to accounts that require a notice be given before funds are withdrawn. The length of time for the notice period is known as the neuron's "dissolve delay". The dissolve delay determines how long the neuron will take to dissolve if the neuron is placed into "dissolve mode". Once dissolved, the neuron owner can unlock the staked balance of ICP. This configuration provides neuron owners with an incentive to vote with a long-term view focused on maximizing their ICP's value at a later date. Neuron owners can configure higher dissolve delays up to a maximum of eight years, but cannot decrease it below the natural passage of time. 

The neuron's voting power is proportional to the quantity of ICP staked within the neuron, the length of their dissolve delay, and the amount of time since the neuron was created. Neurons can be configured to vote automatically or manually. To vote automatically, the neuron can be configured to follow the voting decision of a group of neurons, where it decides to approve a proposal if more than half of the followed group approves, and rejects the proposal if more than half of the followed group rejects. Voting automatically can be useful for neuron owners who may not have the necessary time to evaluate each proposal, or who do not fully understand the proposal's details. 

Anyone holding ICP can create a neuron, and are encouraged to do so through reward incentives such as newly minted ICP tokens. Reward amounts are determined by the amount of ICP locked in the neuron, the neuron's dissolve delay time, the neuron's age, and the proportion of possible votes that it participated into the sum of total voting activity across all neurons. Rewards are distributed this way because the total reward pool is a capped value and is divided between all NNS voters.

Neurons can also be used to submit new proposals to the NNS. To prevent neurons from spamming proposals, a fee is charged to the neuron if their submitted proposal is rejected. 

To learn more about neurons and their attributes, check out the documentation [here](/docs/current/tokenomics/nns/nns-intro#neurons).

### Proposals

If a proposal has a majority approval, it will be accepted and autonomously executed. Proposals each adhere to a specific proposal type, which defines what information the proposal includes. For each proposal type, the NNS maintains a corresponding system function which is executed using the proposal's content to fill the function's parameters whenever a proposal of that type is approved and adopted. Each proposal type is belongs to a proposal topic, such as "#NetworkEconomics" or "#NodeAdmin". 

Each NNS proposal contains the following fields:

- Summary: A field of text that describes the proposal.

- URL: The web address of any additional content that is required to evaluate the proposal. 

- Proposer: The ID of the neuron that submitted the proposal.

- Proposal type: The type of proposal and what topic it belongs to. 

- Parameters: Any parameters that will be passed to the system function that will be executed if the proposal is approved.

- Unique identity: A unique identity value the NNS assigns to each proposal it receives. 

For detailed information about different proposal types and topics, see the documentation [here](/docs/current/tokenomics/nns/nns-intro#topics).

## Using the NNS dapp

To use the NNS dapp, first navigate to the dapp's URL at https://nns.ic0.app/.

You will be prompted to log in with your Internet Identity. If you need to create one, check out the previous module [3.5 Identities and authentication](../level-3/3.5-identities-and-auth.md).

![NNS login](../_attachments/nns0.png)

### Transferring ICP tokens to your Internet Identity Main account

Once logged in, you can see your balance for each token on the NNS dapp. Tokens include ICP, ckBTC, and dapp-specific tokens for dapps that have an SNS, such as OpenChat (CHAT) and Hot or Not (HOT). For this tutorial, we'll be staking ICP in an IC neuron, so assure that you have some ICP tokens available. 

If you need to obtain ICP tokens, they can be purchased through a crypto exchange, or they can be received through other activities such as participating in the NNS governance and receiving grants from the DFINITY foundation. They will need to be sent to the ICP wallet address shown in the NNS dapp beneath the current balance as shown in the screenshot below under the 'Main' account with the balance of `5.10 ICP`:

![NNS dapp 1](../_attachments/nns1.png)

Alternatively, you can send ICP tokens to this Internet Identity address from your local `dfx` developer identity if that is where you have ICP tokens. You can do so with the `dfx ledger` commands. First, get your developer identity principal with the command:

```
dfx identity get-principal
```

This command will return your identity's principal:

```
tsqwz-udeik-5migd-ehrev-pvoqv-szx2g-akh5s-fkyqc-zy6q7-snav6-uqe
```

Then, check the balance of your identity's ledger account to assure that it is the correct account:

```
dfx ledger --network ic balance
```

The flag `--network ic` is required, since we are intending to use real ICP on the mainnet. 

If the balance is correct, then you can transfer ICP tokens to your Internet Identity 'Main' address with the command:

```
dfx ledger --network ic transfer <destination-account-id> --icp <ICP-amount> --memo <numeric-memo>
```

For example, for the 'Main' account in this example, we could transfer 1 ICP to the account with the command:

```
dfx ledger --network ic transfer 365cf45f3521653e866a078b157a8d8701c3f63183a6d41ff8ddb913c4a978d3 --memo Developer Journey --icp 1
```

### Staking ICP in a neuron

To stake your ICP tokens in a neuron, select 'My Neuron Staking' on the left navigation bar. Then select 'Stake Neurons' in the bottom of the window.

![NNS dapp 2](../_attachments/nns2.png)

To stake ICP in a neuron, enter how many you'd like to stake and select the source wallet. 

![NNS dapp 3](../_attachments/nns3.png)

Then, you'll need to set the dissolve delay.

![NNS dapp 4](../_attachments/nns4.png)

To receive voting power, you'll need to set this value to at least 6 months. Click on the 'Min' button to set the minimum value. 

![NNS dapp 5](../_attachments/nns5.png)

To set the maximum value, select the 'Max' button. The maximum dissolve delay is eight years.

![NNS dapp 6](../_attachments/nns6.png)

Then confirm the setting to create your neuron. 

![NNS dapp 7](../_attachments/nns7.png)

Once your neuron has been created, you can follow other neurons. As we discussed earlier, setting up following will automate your neuron's participation in voting on proposals, allowing you to maximize your neuron rewards. To follow a specific topic, select the drop-down menu next to the group you'd like to follow. In this example, we'll select "All except Governance, and SNS & Neurons' Fund".

![NNS dapp 8](../_attachments/nns8.png)

Then, you can select a specific group of neurons to follow by selecting 'Add Followee'.

![NNS dapp 9](../_attachments/nns9.png)

A list of available neurons will be displayed. In this example, we'll follow the 'DFINITY Foundation' neuron.

![NNS dapp 10](../_attachments/nns10.png)

Then confirm that your following settings have been updated.

![NNS dapp 11](../_attachments/nns11.png)

Close this window. Now, let's take a look at the details of our neuron. From the 'My Neuron Staking' page, you will see your neuron, it's staked balance, it's neuron ID, and it's dissolve delay time. Select on the neuron to see additional details.

![NNS dapp 12](../_attachments/nns12.png)

From the neuron's detailed menu, you can execute actions such as increase the staked amount of ICP, increase the dissolve delay, or start dissolving the neuron. You will also see information regarding the neuron's maturity, which will increase over time and by voting on proposals.

![NNS dapp 13](../_attachments/nns13.png)

If you scroll further, you can see advanced details and settings, such as when the neuron was created, it's neuron account ID, and options to participate in the neurons' fund or split the neuron. For more information about these advanced options, check out the documentation [here](/docs/current/tokenomics/token-holders/nns-app-quickstart).

![NNS dapp 14](../_attachments/nns14.png)

Lastly, at the very bottom of the window there will be information about the neurons that are being followed, any hotkeys that are set, and the neuron's voting history.

![NNS dapp 15](../_attachments/nns15.png)

### Interacting with NNS proposals

Earlier, we set up following for our neuron, meaning that the neuron will automatically vote on proposals that fall into the category we configured. To interact with proposals manually, select 'Vote on Proposals' on the left navigation bar, then select 'Internet Computer'. All of the currently available proposals will be displayed.

![NNS dapp 16](../_attachments/nns16.png)

If you click on one, however, you'll notice that you cannot vote on it. That's because the proposals were created before the neuron that we just created, so we aren't eligible to vote on the currently open proposals. All future proposals will be available to us. 

![NNS dapp 17](../_attachments/nns17.png)
