# 5.2 Developing a dapp using the IC Ethereum integration

## Overview

https://xm3ir-rqaaa-aaaap-abhqq-cai.icp0.io/

Designed for experienced Web3 developers, this starter project uses an IC canister to verify the ownership of Ethereum NFTs, with support for both the Sepolia and Goerli testnets in addition to the Ethereum mainnet.

This repository is in early beta testing; please feel free to open an issue to report a bug or request a feature. Thanks!

Note: this starter project is currently undergoing an internal security review. This message will be removed once the review process is complete.

üé¨ Create a New Project
Make sure that Node.js >= 16, dfx >= 0.14, and the latest version of Rust are installed on your system.

Set up Rust canister development with the following command:

rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
Run the following commands in a new, empty project directory:

npx degit dfinity/ic-eth-starter # Download this starter project
dfx start --clean --background # Run dfx in the background
npm run setup # Install packages, deploy canisters, and generate type bindings

npm start # Start the development server
When ready, run dfx deploy --network ic to deploy your application to the Internet Computer.

üîå Prepare a Testnet Wallet
Here is one way to acquire tokens and NFTs on the Sepolia testnet:

Install MetaMask and create a new wallet for testing purposes
Fund your wallet using the Sepolia Faucet (requires signing up for an Alchemy account)
Navigate to MetaMask's E2E Test Dapp
Connect your wallet
In your MetaMask extension, change the network from "Ethereum Mainnet" to "Sepolia" (visual guide)
Scroll down to the "NFTs" section
Press "Deploy" and then "Mint" (may take a few seconds)
Press "Watch all NFTs" and in the MetaMask prompt, click the link with text "Test Dapp NFTs #1"
In the bottom-right of the page (under "TokenID"), press "#1" to view your newly minted NFT
Copy / paste the URL into the IC üîó ETH demo project to verify that you are the owner of the NFT.

üí° Tips and Tricks
Customize your project's code style by editing the .prettierrc file and then running npm run format.
Reduce the latency of update calls by passing the --emulator flag to dfx start.
Install a Motoko package by running npx ic-mops add <package-name>. Here is a list of available packages.
Split your frontend and backend console output by running npm run frontend and npm run backend in separate terminals.
