# System canisters

## Overview

System canisters are canisters that provide a necessary function to the ICP network. These canisters are controlled by the NNS and are upgraded via NNS proposals. These canisters have static canister IDs that projects can reference. One common example of a system canister that is referenced by projects is the Internet Identity canister.
