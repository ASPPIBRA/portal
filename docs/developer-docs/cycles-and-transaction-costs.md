# Cycles and transaction costs

## Overview

When a smart contract canister is deployed to ICP, the resources that the canister uses are paid for using cycles. These resources include storage, messaging, and execution. To obtain cycles, ICP tokens can be converted into cycles. 

Understanding how cycles costs are incurred and what the associated fiat value of these costs are is important for developers to understand so they can budget or plan accordingly for their application. This guide will cover the following topics:

## Units and fiat value

The price of cycles is fixed against the price of [XDR](/docs/current/references/glossary#xdr), where **1 trillion cycles equals 1 XDR**. As of December 18, 2023, the exchange rate for 1 XDR = $1.336610, which is used on this page. The exchange rate for USD/XDR may vary and it will impact the conversion rate. You can view XDR exchange rates [here](https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_sdrv.aspx).

This documentation will use the following units to measure and calculate the number of cycles and their associated fiat value:

| Abbreviation  | Name      | In numbers   | Cycles XDR value  | Cycles USD value  |
|-------------- | --------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------|
| T      | Trillion  | 1_000_000_000_000 | 1            | 1.34              |
| B      | Billion   | 1_000_000_000     | 0.001        | 0.00134           |

## The ICP reverse gas model 

Smart contract canisters deployed on ICP are charged for the resources that they use. Cycles are withdrawn from the canister's cycles wallet whenever the canister performs an action that incurs a charge, such as sending an HTTPS outcall, receiving a message, or executing an instruction. This cost model is sometimes referred to as ICP's 'reverse gas model', since the smart contract canister is responsible for paying the cycles cost, rather than the user. 

:::info
While this may be referred to as the ICP reverse 'gas' model, it is important to note that ICP does not use 'gas' -- it uses cycles. 
::

You can learn more about the ICP reverse gas model [here](https://internetcomputer.org/capabilities/reverse-gas). 

Each canister deployed on ICP has a cycles balance. When a canister is first deployed, it must be deployed with an amount of cycles that covers the cost of creating the canister, then provides enough cycles for the canister's operations. If a canister's cycles balance becomes depleted and it cannot cover the cost of the canister's operations, the canister must be 'topped up', which refers to depositing additional cycles into the canister's cycles balance. 

You can learn how to query a canister's cycles balance [here](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.6-managing-canisters#checking-the-cycles-balance-of-a-canister), and you can learn how to top up a canister [here](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.6-managing-canisters#topping-up-a-canisters-cycles-balance).

### How do ICP costs compare to the EVM gas model?

On other blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, users are responsible for paying the 'gas' charge for every on-chain interaction they incur. For some dapps, that means the user must pay a gas fee for doing tasks as simple as commenting on or liking a video. ICP removes this expensive barrier for users by allowing them to interact with dapps deployed on the network without paying gas fees, instead charging the canisters themselves for the resources used. 

Additionally, gas fees on Ethereum can fluctuate in price unpredictably, resulting in drastically different gas fees based on the current price of ETH and the current network conditions. This can make using dapps on Ethereum difficult and expensive, as one day it may cost significantly more than the day prior or vice versa. Since ICP uses cycles, which have a fixed price based on XDR, the price is predictable and stable. 

One downside of the ICP cycles model in comparison to the EVM gas model is that it requires prerequisite steps and ongoing maintenance for developers. ICP tokens must be converted into cycles, then cycles must be deposited into a canister's cycles balance. Canisters must have their cycles balances maintained and regularly topped up as they continuously use resources, otherwise the canister will be removed from the network if it runs out of cycles. However, a [freezing threshold](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.6-managing-canisters#setting-the-canisters-freezing-threshold) can be set that pauses a canister's executions if the cycles amount is expected to fall below a certain amount, and there are several community tools that have been developed to automate managing a canister's cycles, such as [CycleOps](https://cycleops.dev/).

## Canister transactions

A canister transaction on ICP refers to invoking a function within a smart contract. Transactions can come in the form of messages, executions, data storage, or they can use special features such as HTTPS outcalls, chain-key signing cryptography, and the Bitcoin API integration.

:::caution
For information on transactions regarding **ledgers and tokens**, such as minting and burning transactions, please see the documentation [here](/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/ledger/#transaction-types).
:::

At a high level, transactions can be visualized using the following diagram:

[Transaction overview](./_attachments/transaction-overview.png)

Each type of transaction has a different cycles cost associated with it and the canister responsible for paying the cycles varies based on the type of transaction.

### Canister creation

An initial fee is charged when a canister is first created. Canisters are created by deploying a project onto an instance of the IC replica (locally or on the mainnet), or a canister can be created by another canister that is already running on a replica instance. Canisters created by another canister are referred to as 'child canisters'. The cycles charge for creating a canister is charged to the canister that is being created. 

### Messaging

Messaging refers to calls that are made to a canister's methods. A canister's messaging costs depend on the type of message, the size of the message's request and response bytes, and the number of messages. 

Additional factors of cost include the number of nodes in the subnet the canister is deployed on, the total number of users interacting with the canister, and the number of daily active users. 

Messaging cost drivers include:

- Message type:
    - Query calls: Query data and perform a 'read-only' operation. (There is currently no cost for query calls).
    - Update calls: Makes changes to the canister's state and must go through consensus. 
    - Inter-canister calls: Calls made between canisters.
    - [Calls made by timers and heartbeats](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/periodic-tasks): Periodic calls that are reoccurring. 
- Calls made daily per active user.
- Size of each message's request bytes.
- Instructions executed per message.
- Calls per message.
- Size of the message's request and response bytes per call. 

### Execution

Execution refers to tasks that the canister executes and the number of instructions executed per task and per call. These tasks use compute resources, and rely on 'best-effort compute', meaning they do not pre-allocate compute resources unless otherwise specified, as compute resources are scare and expensive. 

For canisters that do specifically request compute resources, the priority of allocating those resources is achieved through a scheduling strategy. Priority is determined based on the canister's `compute_allocation` setting and the amount of time the canister has been waiting to be scheduled. A non-zero `compute_allocation` will give a canister a higher priority, but does not guarantee execution in a given round. However, you will have to pay a fee in every round for this higher priority.

Execution cost drivers include:

- Instructions executed per call.
- Daily tasks the canister performs. 
- Instructions executed per daily task. 

### Storage
Storage refers to the amount of data the canister stores. 

Storage cost drivers include:

- Storage bytes per user.
- User-independent storage bytes.

Canisters can reserve storage on a subnet through the `memory_allocation` setting. However, the canister will be charged as if the entire amount of allocated storage is being used. 

In order to encourage long-term usage and discourage spiky usage patterns of resources, the Internet Computer uses a *resource reservation mechanism* that was adopted by the community in [NNS proposal 12604](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/126094).

Every time a canister allocates new storage bytes, the system sets aside some amount of cycles from the main balance of the canister. These reserved cycles are used to cover future payments for the newly allocated bytes. The reserved cycles are not transferable and the amount of reserved cycles depends on how full the subnet is. For example, it may cover days, months, or even years of payments for the newly allocated bytes.

The operations that allocate new bytes are:

- Wasm instruction: `memory.grow`.
- System API calls: `ic0.stable_grow()` `ic0.stable64_grow()`.
- Increasing the `memory_allocation` in canister settings.

These operations reserve some amount of cycles by moving them from the main balance of the canister to the reserved cycles balance.
The amount of reserved cycles depends on how many bytes are allocated and on the current subnet usage:

- If subnet usage is below `450GiB`, then the amount of reserved cycles per allocated byte is `0`.
- If subnet usage is above `450GiB`, then the amount of reserved cycles per allocated byte grows linearly depending on the subnet usage from `0` to `10` years worth of storage payments at the subnet capacity (which is currently `750GiB`).

A controller of a canister can disable resource reservation by setting the `reserved_cycles_limit=0` in canister settings.
Such opted-out canisters would not be able to allocate if the subnet usage is above `450GiB` though.

### Special features

Special features aside from messaging, storage, and execution resources have different costs since they use special infrastructure and architectures to provide the feature's functionality. These special features include:

- **HTTPS outcalls**: The cost of HTTPS outcalls is calculated using a unique formula since the feature includes a quadratic component in its implementation. The cost for an HTTPS outcall is calculated using the formula `(3_000_000 + 60_000 * n) * n` for the base fee and `400 * n` each request byte and `800 * n` for each response byte, where `n` is the number of nodes in the subnet. These costs are included in the chart found below in this document. 

- **Bitcoin API**: Pricing for the **Bitcoin API** is available in the [Bitcoin API documentation](./integrations/bitcoin/bitcoin-how-it-works.md).

- **Chain-key signing API**: Pricing for the **Chain-key signing API** is available in the [Chain-key signing / threshold ECDSA documentation](./integrations/t-ecdsa/t-ecdsa-how-it-works.md).

### Replication

Replication refers to the number of times a canister is replicated, which will depend on the subnet that the canister is deployed to. 

#### Local development 

When a canister is deployed to a local development environment, the canister is deployed to a single node (the local replica). Cycles charged to locally deployed canisters have a cost that is 1/13th the cost when deployed to a 13-node subnet. In local development environments, cycles can be fabricated using dfx. 

#### Mainnet development

On a 13-node subnet, the canister is running on 13 nodes and therefore is replicated 13 times, whereas on a 34-node subnet, the canister running on 34 nodes and therefore is replicated 34 times. The cost for resources on a 13-node subnet is different than the cost for resources on a 34-node subnet. 

If you intend to deploy canisters on high-replication subnets, your canister should be prepared for an increase in cycles prices with an increase in the subnet's replication factor when the subnet grows over time. For this reason it is recommended to attach more cycles to a call than the current price for a high-replication subnet of a given size suggests.

## Who is responsible for paying cycles?

Canisters are responsible for paying cycles for their own canister creation, compute resources, storage resources, and execution resources. For certain canister calls, however, the canister responsible for paying the cycles may vary. 

For example, for inter-canister calls and the associated bytes, the canister sending this call is responsible for paying the required cycles. If there is an inter-canister call chain, for example canister A â†’ canister B â†’ canister C, then canister A pays for the sending request-response pair between canister A and canister B,  and canister B pays for sending the request-response pair between canister B and canister C. Additionally, each canister pays for processing that happens locally, meaning canister A pays for processing the response from canister B while canister B pays for processing the request from canister A.

In contrast, for ingress messages the receiving canister is responsible for paying the consumed cycles. 

Canisters that are created from another canister (child canisters) are responsible for paying for themselves. 

## Cycles price breakdown

The chart below details on the cost of compute and storage transactions as well as management canister calls. A thorough example how the cost of running a canister on a 13-node app subnet is computed can be found [here](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Comparing_Canister_Cycles_vs_Performance_Counter).

The USD cost for transactions below is based on the cycle costs indicated for 13-node and 34-node subnets. 1 XDR is equal to 1 trillion cycles. The cost per transaction is shown in USD (XDR/USD exchange rate as of December 18, 2023). The exchange rate for USD/XDR may vary and it will impact the conversion rate. You can view XDR exchange rates [here](https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_sdrv.aspx).

## Counting instructions

To count the number of executed instructions in Motoko canisters, the [Motoko function `countInstructions`](/docs/current/motoko/main/base/ExperimentalInternetComputer#function-countinstructions) can be used.

To get information about message execution, canister performance, and executed instructions, the IC performance counters can be queried. You can find more information about the performance counters in the [IC interface specification](/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#system-api-performance-counter).
