# Message inspection

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Rust", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

A canister can inspect an ingress message and either accept or decline the message through the canister's HTTP interface. If the message is accepted, the canister will execute it.

A canister that does not have a Wasm module installed will reject any ingress messages. If the canister does not implement `canister_inspect_message`, all ingress messages will be accepted.

The `canister_inspect_message` functionality should not be used for definitive access control. This is because it is executed by a single replica, without full consensus, and its result could be spoofed by a malicious boundary node. However, since it does not go through full consensus, a malicious user cannot drain cycles from your canister because you don’t pay the cost for the message going through consensus.

Using the `canister_inspect_message` endpoint, the canister can invoke `ic0.accept_message : () → ()` to accept the message.

You can learn more in the [IC interface specification](/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#ingress-message-inspection).

This guide will describe how to use `inspect_message` within a Rust canister.

## `inspect_message`

The `canister_inspect_message` entrypoint can be defined and exported by a Rust canister using `#[inspect_message]`.

The function within this attribute cannot have a return value, and a canister can only have one `canister_inspect_message` entrypoint.

```rust
#[inspect_message]
fn inspect_message_function() {
    if /* some condition */ {
        ic_cdk::api::call::accept_message();
    } else {
        /* trap or simply not call accept_message to deny*/
    }
}
```

## `inspec_message` with `guards`

To obtain the ingress parameters while implementing `canister_inspect_message`, you must implement a `guard`. A guard is for rejecting a message. Any reply from non-guard code is either a successful reply or a trap.

You can implement a guard in your code such as:

```rust
#[update(guard = "can_prepare")]
#[candid_method(update)]
fn create_batch() -> CreateBatchResponse {
    STATE.with(|s| match s.borrow_mut().create_batch(time()) {
        Ok(batch_id) => CreateBatchResponse { batch_id },
        Err(msg) => trap(&msg),
    })
}
```
