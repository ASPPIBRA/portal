# Variants as Arguments

## Overview 

This document aims to provide examples of passing in variants as a function argument.

### Variants 

A `variant` type represents a value that is from exactly one of the given cases, or **tags**. Similar to enums, they let you differentiate between different types within the same variable.

The following example defines a `Day` type representing a day of the week. It utilizes a switch statement to match the input `Day with one of its variants, returning the corresponding full name of the day.

```
type Day = {#sun; #mon; #tue; #wed; #thu; #fri; #sat};

public query func toText(d : Day) : Text {
  switch d {
     case (#sun) "Sunday";
     case (#mon) "Monday";
     case (#tue) "Tuesday";
     case (#wed) "Wednesday";
     case (#thu) "Thursday";
     case (#fri) "Friday";
     case (#sat) "Saturday";
   };
};
