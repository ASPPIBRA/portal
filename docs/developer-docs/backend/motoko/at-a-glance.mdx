# 4: Motoko quickstart

## Overview

This at-a-glance cheat sheet summarizes the steps to follow for quick reference.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, assure you have set up your developer environment according to the instructions in the [developer environment guide](./dev-env.md).

## Creating a new project

Open a terminal window on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.

Create a new project and change to the project directory.

<Tabs groupId="version">
<TabItem value="0-17-0" label="dfx v0.17.0 or newer" default>

Use `dfx new <project_name>` to create a new project:

```
dfx new hello_world
```

You will be prompted to select a language that your backend canister will use:

```
? Select a backend language: ›  
❯ Motoko
  Rust
  TypeScript (Azle)
  Python (Kybra)
```

Then, select a frontend framework for your frontend canister, or select 'No frontend canister':

```
  ? Select a frontend framework: ›  
❯ SvelteKit
  React
  Vue
  Vanilla JS
  No JS template
  No frontend canister
```

Lastly, you can include extra features to be added to your project:

```
  ? Add extra features (space to select, enter to confirm) ›
⬚ Internet Identity
⬚ Bitcoin (Regtest)
⬚ Frontend tests
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="0-16-1" label="dfx v0.16.1 or older" default>

```bash
dfx new hello
cd hello
npm install
```

For projects created with `dfx new` (Motoko and Rust) the command automatically generates the project's default configuration and two default smart contracts. 

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Editing the default files

Edit the `src/<project_name>_backend` files to define your service or application.

Edit the `src/<project_name>_frontend` files with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS that provides the frontend for your service or application.

## Starting the deployment environment

Start the Internet Computer for local development or check your connection to the Internet Computer for network deployment:
- [Local deployment](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/deploy/local).
- [Mainnet deployment](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/deploy/mainnet).

## Register, build, and deploy locally or on the mainnet 

To deploy locally, use the command:

```
dfx deploy
```

For deploying to the mainnet, use: `--network ic`.

```
dfx deploy --network <network>
```

## View your service or application in a browser, using the URLS in the output of the `dfx deploy` command:

```
...
