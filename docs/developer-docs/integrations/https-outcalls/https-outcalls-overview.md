# Make an HTTP request

## Overview 

Canister smart contracts can make a request to a URL using [HTTPS outcalls](https://internetcomputer.org/https-outcalls). HTTPS outcalls can be used to directly obtain off-chain data or interact with off-chain systems, such as Web 2.0 services or enterprise IT infrastructure.

HTTPS outcalls enable a wide range of applications. For example, oracle services can directly integrate with ICP in a trustless manner, and dapps can provide user notifications or anything else that requires communication with servers on the Internet.
