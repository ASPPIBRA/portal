# Threshold Schnorr signatures

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Concept"]} />

## Overview

Schnorr signatures are a type of digital signature scheme popularly used amongst blockchain networks because they are efficient, simple, and allow for multi-signatures, threshold signatures, and aggregated signatures to be used on the network. On ICP, threshold Schnorr signatures enable canisters to hold a wider range of digital assets and allow for direct integrations with other chains like Solana.

Specifically, threshold Schnorr signatures on ICP provide:

- Support for BIP-340, which is Bitcoin's variant of Schnorr used in ordinals such as BRC-20.

- Support for Ed25519 signatures, which are used by chains such as Solana, Cardano, Polkadot, and Ripple. Ed25519 is also a popular signature scheme outside of blockchains for Web2 functions such as signing x.509 certificates.

- Provide higher signature throughput than threshold ECDSA signatures.

- Allow canisters to obtain their own Schnorr public key and address, unlocking the ability for them to derive addresses on other chains, then authorize and submit transactions on those chains.

- Enable Schnorr signatures to be computed on arbitrary messages.

## Using threshold Schnorr signatures

To demonstrate how threshold Schnorr signatures can be used, an example canister using the threshold Schnorr API is available. Details on the API can be found in the [IC specification repo](https://github.com/dfinity/interface-spec/pull/288).

:::caution
This is a sample project that should not be used in production. The key material used in this example could be accessed by node providers and is not considered secure for production applications.

### Running the sample project locally

To run the sample threshold Schnorr project locally, first clone the GitHub repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/domwoe/schnorr_canister.git
cd schnorr_canister
```

Then, use the script included in the repo to deploy the sample canisters locally and generate the canisters' Candid interface.

```
dfx start --clean --background
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Viewing the canister on the mainnet

This sample threshold Schnorr canister has been deployed to the mainnet with canister ID `6fwhw-fyaaa-aaaap-qb7ua-cai`.

You can view the canister's Candid UI at https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.icp0.io/?id=6fwhw-fyaaa-aaaap-qb7ua-cai and you can view the total number of signatures generated by this canister at https://6fwhw-fyaaa-aaaap-qb7ua-cai.raw.icp0.io/.

You can also use the canister on the [Blast Playground](https://jglts-daaaa-aaaai-qnpma-cai.ic0.app/831.de93c1521f2395ef78586691ca27d4d3a0a937ebd0ffa442a1479769).

### Adding the canister to an existing project

To add the example threshold Schnorr canister to your project, add the following configuration to your project's `dfx.json` file:

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "schnorr_canister": {
      "type": "custom",
      "candid": "https://github.com/domwoe/schnorr_canister/releases/latest/download/schnorr_canister.did",
      "wasm": "https://github.com/domwoe/schnorr_canister/releases/latest/download/schnorr_canister.wasm.gz",
      "remote": {
        "id": {
          "ic": "6fwhw-fyaaa-aaaap-qb7ua-cai",
          "playground": "6fwhw-fyaaa-aaaap-qb7ua-cai"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
