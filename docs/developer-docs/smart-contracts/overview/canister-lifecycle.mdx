# Canister lifecycle

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Concept"]} />

## Create

A developer can create an empty canister on ICP by calling the system canister.
It can be done using the `NNS frontend dapp` in the browser or `dfx` in the command line.
The developer can specify the initial canister settings and choose the target subnet.
Once the canister is created, the developer gets its canister ID and becomes the controller of the canister.

## Install

The next step after canister creation is installing code.
Typically, the developer writes the code in a high-level language and compiles it into a Wasm binary.
The actual installation happens when the developer calls the `install_code` endpoint of the system canister passing the canister ID and the Wasm binary to it.
The `dfx` tool has a command for making this call.

## Call

After installation, the canister accepts and processes messages (calls) from users and other canisters.
Only the public endpoints of the canister can be called.
These endpoints correspond to exported Wasm functions that are annotated with `canister_update` or `canister_query` in their names.

## Maintain

Certain system operations that change the state of the canister can be performed only by the controllers of the canister.
The most important operation is upgrading the canister by installing different Wasm binary.
In the initial stages of development, the canister is usually controlled by its developer, which allows the developer to iterate quickly.
As the canister becomes mature and production ready, the control over it should move to a DAO in order to make the canister secure and trustworthy.

Since ICP has the reverse gas model, the canister pays with cycles for its execution, storage, and other operations.
This means that controllers and/or users of the canister have to ensure that the canister does not run out of cycles.
If the canister runs out of cycles, then it will be uninstalled by dropping its Wasm binary and its storage.

If the canister is no longer used or needed, a controller of the canister can delete it.
ICP guarantees that the canister ID will not be reused for another canister.
