# Compile

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

After you have written the code for your project's canisters, you need to compile the code into a WebAssembly module before it can be deployed on ICP. To build your canister's Wasm module, you can use the `dfx build` command. The `dfx build` command looks for source code to compile for each canister configured under the `canisters` section in the `dfx.json` configuration file. It can be used to build a specific canister or all canisters defined in the project's [`dfx.json`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/dfx-json-reference) file.

Check out the [default project template](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/default-template) for more information on `dfx.json`.

## How code is compiled to Wasm

WebAssembly (Wasm) is platform independent and designed to run on a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm itself is not a programming language; it is the result of a programming language being comnpiled and converted into executable machine code. When canister code is compiled into Wasm, the system compiler creates a Wasm module in either a binary format (.wasm) or a compressed binary (.wasm.gz).

This generated Wasm module includes a runtime system which implements a garbage collector function and uses the Wasm heap storage. Then, this module is implemented when the canister's code is installed. 

On ICP, [Wasmtime](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/) is supported to run canister smart contracts. 

## Compiling your canister

Before using the `dfx build` command, first you need to [create the canister](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/create).

Verify the location of your project's files and their file names. If you modify these settings, be sure to edit your project's `dfx.json` file to reflect the current intended configuration.

Then, [build your canister](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-build) with the command:

```
dfx build
```

This command must be run from within the project's directory.

When this command is executed, the following steps happen:

- The source code for each canister defined in `dfx.json` is compiled into a Wasm module.

- If a canister being built is written in Motoko, type declarations are automatically generated using Candid.

- If a canister being built is written in Rust, the build process checks for Rust vulnerabilities.


:::info
When a canister is deployed with [`dfx deploy`](/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy), the `dfx build` command is run in the background as part of the deployment process.

Once your canister has been compiled, it is ready to be deployed.
