## Overview

Canisters contain both code and state. Once you have written the code for a canister, the canister doesn't exist until it is registered with IC, either locally or the mainnet.

A canister can be created without first compiling any code. When canisters are created with `dfx canister create`, they are empty and do not contain program code. The code must be compiled into Wasm and installed into the empty canister before it can be deployed.

## Creating canisters 

When a canister is created, either locally or on the mainnet, the following steps happen:

- The canister ID is registered with the local replica or the mainnet for each canister in the project's `dfx.json` file.

- The following canister components are created:
      - List of controllers.
      - Cycles balance.
      - Reserved cycles balance.
      - Canister status.
      - Resource reservations.

- A cycles wallet canister is created for the user principal that executed the command if one does not exist. This wallet canister's ID is returned in the command line output.

- The canister's ID is returned in the command line.

To create a canister locally, the `dfx canister create` command can be used:

```
dfx canister create hello_world // Create a canister locally
dfx canister create hello_world --network ic // Create a canister on the mainnet
dfx canister create --all --network ic // Create all canisters in the project's dfx.json file
```

:::caution 
Creating a canister on the mainnet will cost [cycles](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/cycles/cycles-faucet)

At this step, settings can be configured for the canister using the optional flags. [View the full list of settings that can be configured](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#options-1).
