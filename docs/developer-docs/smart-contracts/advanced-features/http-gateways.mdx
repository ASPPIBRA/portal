# HTTP gateways

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

The ICP HTTP gateway protocol enables conventional HTTP clients to interact with the ICP network. HTTP gateways run adjacent to ICP and provide a connection used by software such as web browsers to send and receive standard HTTP requests and responses, including static assets, such as HTML, JavaScript, images, or videos. The HTTP gateway makes this workflow possible by translating standard HTTP requests into API canister calls that ICP canisters can understand and vice versa for HTTP responses.

There are several HTTP gateway instances maintained for ICP, but it should be noted that an HTTP gateway is a centralized component that could become compromised, creating a threat for users receiving HTTP content. 

DFINITY exclusively controls the HTTP gateways that serve canisters on `ic0.app` and `icp0.io`. Developers can then also configure their own [custom domains](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/web-apps/custom-domains/using-custom-domains) to point at the DFINITY controlled HTTP gateways.

Alternatively, developers can run their own HTTP gateways on their custom domains instead of using the DFINITY controlled gateways, but this is not well supported yet. 

For a more secure solution, it is possible to run your own HTTP gateway instance locally.

### Terminology

- **Request**: A message sent to a server or endpoint.

- **Client**: A service that is able to send an HTTP formatted request and receive a response from a server.

- **Gateway**: Enables the transfer of inbound and outbound messages.

## HTTP request lifecycle

On ICP, an HTTP request goes through the following lifecycle:

1. An HTTP client makes an outbound request.

2. The HTTP gateway intercepts the request and resolves the canister ID of the request's destination.

3. The request is encoded with Candid and sent in a query call to the destination canister's `http_request` method.

4. This request is sent to an ICP API boundary node, which will then forward the request to a replica node on the relevant subnet.

5. The canister receives and processes the request, then returns the response.

6. The HTTP gateway decodes the Candid encoding on the response.

7. If the canister requests it, the gateway sends the request again via an update call to the canister's `http_request_update` method. The update call goes through consensus on the subnet.

8. If the response size [exceeds the maximum response size](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/maintain/resource-limits/), the HTTP gateway fetches additional response body data through query calls.

9. The HTTP gateway validates the response's certificate, if applicable.

10. The HTTP gateway returns the decoded response to the HTTP client.

Additional details can be found in the [HTTP gateway specification](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/http-gateway-protocol-spec).

## Running a local HTTP gateway

To run your own local HTTP gateway, a proof-of-concept implementation can be used that enables a secure end-to-end connection with canisters deployed on ICP.

This implementation features:

- Translation between HTTP asset requests and ICP API calls.

- Detects ICP domains from principals and custom domain records.

- Terminates TLS connections locally.

- Bypasses remote gateway denylists.

- Resolves crypto domains.

### Installation

You can download the pre-built installation package for your [operating system](https://github.com/dfinity/http-proxy?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). 

Once installed, you will have the option to start or stop the IC HTTP proxy service. Start the service to begin using it.
