# HTTP gateways

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

The ICP HTTP gateway protocol enables conventional HTTP clients, such as a web browser, to interact with the ICP network. Through the HTTP gateway, web browsers can send and receive standard HTTP requests and responses, including static assets, such as HTML, JavaScript, images, or videos. The HTTP gateway makes this workflow possible by translating standard HTTP requests into API canister calls that ICP canisters can understand and vice versa for HTTP responses.

There are several HTTP gateway nodes running on ICP, but it should be noted that an HTTP gateway node could become compromised, creating a threat for canisters. Compromised gateways are threats even for canisters that are considered 'secure', such that they use certify assets, use a default client, and do not maintain their own certification checking.

For a more secure solution, it is possible to run your own HTTP gateway instance locally.

### Terminology

- **Request**: A message sent to a server or endpoint.

- **Client**: A service that is able to send an HTTP formatted request and receive a response from a server.

- **Gateway**: Enables the transfer of inbound and outbound messages.

## HTTP request lifecycle

On ICP, an HTTP request goes through the following lifecycle:

1. An HTTP client makes an outbound request.

2. The HTTP gateway intercepts the request and resolves the canister ID of the request's destination.

3. The request is encoded with Candid and sent in a query call to the destination canister's `http_request` method.

4. This request is send to an ICP API boundary node, which will then forward the request to a replica node on the relevant subnet.

5. The canister receives and processes the request, then returns the response.

6. The HTTP gateway decodes the Candid encoding on the response and sends the request again via an update call to the canister's `http_request_update` method. The update call goes through consensus on the subnet.

7. If necessary, the HTTP gateway fetches additional response body data through query calls.

8. The HTTP gateway validates the response's certificate, if applicable.

9. The HTTP gateway returns the decoded response to the HTTP client.

Additional details can be found in the [HTTP gateway specification](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/http-gateway-protocol-spec).

## Running a local HTTP gateway

To run your own local HTTP gateway, a proof-of-concept implementation can be used that enables a secure end-to-end connection with canisters deployed on ICP.

This implementation features:

- Translation between HTTP asset requests and ICP API calls.

- Detects ICP domains from principals and custom domain records.

- Terminates TLS connections locally.

- Bypasses remote gateway denylists.

- Resolves crypto domains.

### Prerequisites

- Download and install [yarn package manger](https://yarnpkg.com/).

- Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).


- #### Step 1: Clone the GitHub repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/http-proxy.git
```

- #### Step 2: Install the project's dependencies:

```
cd http-proxy
npm install --global yarn
yarn set version 3.5.0
yarn install
```

- #### Step 3: Build and run the project:

```
yarn build
yarn start
```

You should see output that indicates the local HTTP gateway is ready to use:
