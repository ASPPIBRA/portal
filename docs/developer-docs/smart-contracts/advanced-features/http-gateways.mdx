# HTTP gateways

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

The ICP HTTP gateway protocol enables conventional HTTP clients to interact with the ICP network. HTTP gateways run adjacent to ICP and provide a connect used by software such as web browsers to retrieve and digest canister code and assets, such as HTML, JavaScript, images, or videos. The HTTP gateway makes this workflow possible by translating standard HTTP requests into API canister calls that ICP can understand.

There are several HTTP gateway instances maintained for ICP, but it should be noted that an HTTP gateway is a centralized component that could become compromised, creating a threat for users receiving HTTP content. Compromised gateways are threats even for canisters that are considered 'secure', such that they use certify assets, use a default client, and do not maintain their own certification checking.

DFINITY exclusively controls the HTTP gateways that serve canisters on `ic0.app` and `icp0.io`. Developers can then also configure their own [custom domains](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/web-apps/custom-domains/using-custom-domains) to point at the DFINITY controlled HTTP gateways.

Alternatively, developers can run their own HTTP gateways on their custom domains instead of using the DFINITY controlled gateways, but this is not well supported yet. 

For a more secure solution, it is possible to run your own HTTP gateway instance locally.

### Terminology

- **Request**: A message sent to a server or endpoint.

- **Client**: A service that is able to send an HTTP formatted request and receive a response from a server.

- **Gateway**: Enables the transfer of inbound and outbound messages.

## HTTP gateway workflow

On ICP, an HTTP request is handled by an HTTP client using the following workflow:

1. An HTTP client makes an outbound request.

2. The HTTP gateway intercepts the request and resolves the canister ID of the request's destination.

3. The request is encoded with Candid and sent in a query call to the destination canister's `http_request` method.

4. ICP's API gateway intercepts this request, resolves the canister ID based on the hostname address, and then forwards the request to the relevant replica node. All requests made to ICP through an HTTP gateway are forwarded through this API gateway.

5. The canister receives and processes the request, then returns the response.

6. The HTTP gateway decodes the Candid encoding on the response.

7. If the canister requests it, the gateway sends the request again via an update call to the canister's `http_request_update` method. The update call goes through consensus on the subnet.

8. If necessary, the HTTP gateway fetches additional response body data through query calls.

9. The HTTP gateway validates the response's certificate, if applicable.

10. The HTTP gateway returns the decoded response to the HTTP client.

Additional details can be found in the [HTTP gateway specification](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/http-gateway-protocol-spec).

## Running a local HTTP gateway

To run your own local HTTP gateway, a proof-of-concept implementation can be used that enables a secure end-to-end connection with canisters deployed on ICP.

This implementation features:

- Translation between HTTP asset requests and ICP API calls.

- Detects ICP domains from principals and custom domain records.

- Terminates TLS connections locally.

- Bypasses remote gateway denylists.

- Resolves crypto domains.

### Prerequisites

- Download and install [yarn package manger](https://yarnpkg.com/).

- Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

### Installation

- #### Step 1: Download and install the `http-proxy` repo

You can download the pre-built installation package for your [operating system](https://github.com/dfinity/http-proxy?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). 

Alternatively, you can clone the GitHub repo and build it manually:

```
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/http-proxy.git
cd http-proxy
npm install --global yarn
yarn set version 3.5.0
yarn install
yarn build
yarn start
```

Once the `http-proxy` is running, you should see output that indicates the local HTTP gateway is ready to use:

```
{"level":30, "time": "2024-06-13T22:41:28.962Z","pid":41696,"hostname":"JessieMgeonsMBP.attlocal.net","name":"IC HTTP Proxy UI","msg":"Preparing interface"}
{"level":30, "time": "2024-06-13T22:41:28.981Z","pid":41696,"hostname":"JessieMgeonsMBP.attlocal.net","name":"IC HTTP Proxy UI","msg":"Interface is ready"}
```
