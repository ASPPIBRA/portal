# Security best practices: Data storage

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Security", "Concept"]} />

## Rust: Use `thread_local!` with `Cell/RefCell` for state variables and put all your globals in one basket

### Security concern

Canisters need global mutable state. In Rust, there are several ways to achieve this. However, some options can lead e.g. to memory corruption.

### Recommendation

- [Use `thread_local!` with `Cell/RefCell` for state variables](https://mmapped.blog/posts/01-effective-rust-canisters.html#use-threadlocal) (from [effective Rust canisters](https://mmapped.blog/posts/01-effective-rust-canisters.html)).

- [Put all your globals in one basket](https://mmapped.blog/posts/01-effective-rust-canisters.html#clear-state) (from [effective Rust canisters](https://mmapped.blog/posts/01-effective-rust-canisters.html)).

## Limit the amount of data that can be stored in a canister per user

### Security concern

If a user is able to store a big amount of data on a canister, this may be abused to fill up the canister storage and make the canister unusable.

### Recommendation

Limit the amount of data that can be stored in a canister per user. This limit has to be checked whenever data is stored for a user in an update call.

## Consider using stable memory, version it, test it

### Security concern

Canister memory is not persisted across upgrades. If data needs to be kept across upgrades, a natural thing to do is to serialize the canister memory in `pre_upgrade`, and deserialize it in `post_upgrade`. However, the available number of instructions for these methods is limited. If the memory grows too big, the canister can no longer be updated.

### Recommendation

- Stable memory is persisted across upgrades and can be used to address this issue.

- [Consider using stable memory](https://mmapped.blog/posts/01-effective-rust-canisters.html#stable-memory-main) (from [effective Rust canisters](https://mmapped.blog/posts/01-effective-rust-canisters.html)). See also the disadvantages discussed there.

- [Version stable memory](https://mmapped.blog/posts/01-effective-rust-canisters.html#version-stable-memory) (from [effective Rust canisters](https://mmapped.blog/posts/01-effective-rust-canisters.html)).

- [Test the upgrade hooks](https://mmapped.blog/posts/01-effective-rust-canisters.html#test-upgrades) (from [effective Rust canisters](https://mmapped.blog/posts/01-effective-rust-canisters.html)).

- See also the section on upgrades in [how to audit an Internet Computer canister](https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/788-How_to_audit_an_Internet_Computer_canister) (though focused on Motoko).

- Write tests for stable memory to avoid bugs.

- Some libraries (mostly work in progress or partly unfinished) that people work on:

    - [https://github.com/dfinity/stable-structures](https://github.com/dfinity/stable-structures)

    - HashMap: [https://github.com/dfinity/stable-structures/pull/1](https://github.com/dfinity/stable-structures/pull/1) (currently not production ready.)

    - [https://github.com/seniorjoinu/ic-stable-memory](https://github.com/seniorjoinu/ic-stable-memory)

- See [current limitations of the Internet Computer](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Current_limitations_of_the_Internet_Computer), sections "Long running upgrades" and "\[de\]serialiser requiring additional wasm memory".

- For example, [Internet Identity](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity) uses stable memory directly to store user data.

## Consider encrypting sensitive data on canisters

### Security concern

By default, canisters provide integrity but not confidentiality. Data stored on canisters can be read by nodes / replicas.

### Recommendation

- Consider end-to-end encrypting any private or personal data (e.g. userâ€™s personal or private information) on canisters.

- The example dapp [encrypted notes](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/encrypted-notes-dapp) illustrates how end-to-end encryption can be done.

## Create backups

### Security concern

A canister could be rendered unusable so it could never be upgraded again e.g. due to the following reasons:

- It has a faulty upgrade process (due to some bug from the dapp developer).

- The state becomes inconsistent / corrupt because of a bug in the code that persists data.

### Recommendation

- Make sure methods used in upgrading are tested or the canister becomes immutable.

- It may be useful to have a disaster recovery strategy that makes it possible to reinstall the canister.

- See the "Backup and recovery" section in [how to audit an Internet Computer canister](https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/788-How_to_audit_an_Internet_Computer_canister)
