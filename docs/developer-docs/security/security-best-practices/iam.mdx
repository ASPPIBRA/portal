## Make sure specific user actions require authentication

### Security concern

If this is not the case, an attacker may be able to perform sensitive actions on behalf of a user, compromising their account.

### Recommendation

- The caller of every canister call the caller can be identified. The calling [principal](/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#principal) can be accessed using the system API’s methods `ic0.msg_caller_size` and `ic0.msg_caller_copy` (see [here](/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#system-api-imports)). If an identity provider such as Internet Identity is used, [the principal is the user identity for this specific origin](/docs/current/references/ii-spec#identity-design-and-data-model). If some actions (e.g. access to user’s account data or account specific operations) should be restricted to a principal or a set of principals, then this must be explicitly checked in the canister call. An example in Rust can be found below:

```rust
// Let pk be the public key of a principal that is allowed to perform
// this operation. This pk could be stored in the canister's state.
if caller() != Principal::self_authenticating(pk) {  ic_cdk::trap(...) }

// Alternatively, if the canister keeps data for different principals
// in e.g. a map such as BTreeMap<Principal, UserData>, then the canister
// must ensure that each caller can only access and perform operations
// on their own data:
if let Some(user_data) = user_data_store.get_mut(&caller()) {
    // perform operations on the user's data
}
```
- In Rust, the `ic_cdk` crate can be used to authenticate the caller using `ic_cdk::api::caller`. Make sure the returned principal is of type `Principal::self_authenticating` and identify the user’s account using the public key of that principal. See the example code above.

- Do authentication as early as possible in the call to avoid unauthenticated actions and potentially expensive operations before authentication. It is also a good idea to [deny service to anonymous users](#disallow-the-anonymous-principal-in-authenticated-calls).

- Do not rely on authentication performed during [ingress message inspection](#do-not-rely-on-ingress-message-inspection).

## Disallow the anonymous principal in authenticated calls

### Security concern

The caller from the system API (e.g. `ic0::api::caller` in Rust) may also return `Principal::anonymous()`. In authenticated calls, this is probably undesired, and could have security implications, since this would behave like a shared account for anyone that does unauthenticated calls.

### Recommendation

In authenticated calls, make sure the caller is not anonymous and return an error or trap if it is. This could be done centrally by using a helper method. An example in Rust can be found below:
```rust
fn caller() -> Result<Principal, String> {
    let caller = ic0::api::caller();
    // The anonymous principal is not allowed to interact with canister.
    if caller == Principal::anonymous() {
        Err(String::from(
            "Anonymous principal not allowed to make calls.",
        ))
    } else {
        Ok(caller)
    }
}
```

## Do not rely on ingress message inspection

### Security concern

The correct execution of [`canister_inspect_message`](/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#system-api-inspect-message) is not guaranteed because it is executed by a single node and if that node is malicious, it can simply skip this check. In that case the update call would be executed without any message inspection checks.

Also note that for inter-canister calls `canister_inspect_message` is not invoked.

### Recommendation

Your canisters should not rely on the correct execution of `canister_inspect_message`. This in particular means that no security critical code, such as [access control checks](#make-sure-any-action-that-only-a-specific-user-should-be-able-to-do-requires-authentication), should be solely performed in that method. Such checks **must** be performed as part of an update method to guarantee reliable execution. Ideally, they are executed both in the `canister_inspect_message` function and a guard function.

## Use a well-audited authentication service and client side ICP libraries

### Security concern

Implementing user authentication and canister calls yourself in your web app is error prone and risky. For example, if canister calls are implemented from scratch, there may be bugs around signature creation or verification.

### Recommendation

-   Consider using and identity provider such as [Internet Identity](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity) for authentication, use [agent-js](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js) for making canister calls, and the [auth-client](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/tree/main/packages/auth-client) for interacting with Internet Identity from your dapp.

-   You may consider alternative authentication frameworks on ICP for authentication.

## Set an appropriate session timeout

### Security concern

Currently, Internet Identity issues delegations with an expiry time. This expiry time can be set in the [auth-client](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/tree/main/packages/auth-client). After a delegation expires, the user has to re-authenticate. Setting a good value is a trade-off between security and usability.

### Recommendation

See the [OWASP recommendations](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#session-expiration). A timeout of 30 minutes should be set for security sensitive applications.

The [auth-client](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/tree/main/packages/auth-client) supports [idle timeouts](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/tree/main/packages/auth-client#idle-management).

## Don’t use fetchRootKey in agent-js in production

### Security concern

`agent.fetchRootKey()` can be used in [agent-js](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js) to fetch the root subnet threshold public key from a status call in test environments. This key is used to verify threshold signatures on certified data received through canister update calls. Using this method in a production web app gives an attacker the option to supply their own public key, invalidating all authenticity guarantees of update responses.

### Recommendation

Never use `agent.fetchRootKey()` in production builds, only in test builds. Not calling this method will result in the hard coded root subnet public key of the mainnet being used for signature verification, which is the desired behavior in production.

## Integrating Internet Identity on mobile devices

### Security concern

Internet Identity has a standardized way for web applications to request authentication of a user. This client authentication protocol allows a client dapp front-end to obtain a delegation signed by the Internet Identity for a locally generated session keypair. Using this delegation in combination with the session key allows the dapp front-end to make authenticated calls towards the back-end canister. Such calls need to be digitally signed by the session private key. The IC will verify the signature and verify if there is a delegation (or chain of delegations) from II key to the  session public key.

The II client authentication protocol leverages the browser’s post postMessage API to communicate between the client origin and the II origin. This protocol allows II to authenticate the origin of the authorization request using the hostname. Note that as part of the client authentication protocol, a dapp can specify an alternative origin by following the alternative frontend origins requirements.

Upon successful authentication, II will return a delegation for the principal derived from the users’ II for the specific front-end origin. This serves two purposes. First, a client dapp can’t use this delegation on other dapps to impersonate the user. Second, multiple client dapps can’t correlate user behavior across dapps, thereby reducing privacy. A dapp with a different front-end origin won’t be able to request authentication for your dapp which provides protection against certain phishing attacks.

When integrating a mobile application with II, the implementation is not straightforward since a mobile app can’t call the postMessage API. It is tempting to create a simple “proxy” web front-end served by the dapp as shown in the sequence diagram below. The mobile application can load this proxy to complete the normal II authorization flow. Upon completion, this proxy web app provides the delegation back to the mobile app.



However, without any precautions, this proxy would happily accept malicious requests to authenticate the user and might return the delegation back to an attacker. 

Such an attack would start by phishing the user by means of a malicious mobile or web application. The user is asked to authenticate through II. However, instead of using II directly, the attacker abuses the open proxy to authenticate the user for the dapp under which the vulnerable proxy is running. The attacker would generate a session key and ask the proxy to use the session public key in the II authentication protocol. Through this method, II issues a signed delegation for the users II derived for the front-end origin of the proxy. This delegation could leak to the attacker who can use it to impersonate the user. In general, the delegation could leak through an insecure communication channel between the proxy and the mobile app or through observation of the IC state.

The attack requires four conditions:
An attacker can provide a session key to be used in the II client authentication protocol.
The client authentication protocol is initiated for a target front-end hostname.
The user completes the II authentication protocol.
The attacker can obtain the delegation which is signed by the II canister.

Conditions 1, 2 and 3 can be satisfied by convincing the user to initiate an authentication flow with a session public key which is chosen by the attacker by loading the proxy from an attacker controlled mobile or web application. Concretely, an attacker would execute a phishing attack where a victim is directed to the proxy from an unsuspicious application. For example, the victim is convinced that the attacker is issuing an airdrop. The victim has to download a corresponding malicious mobile app that requires II authentication. This malicious mobile app would load the proxy (step 3) similarly to how the legitimate mobile app would. The malicious app would ask the proxy to authenticate the user for an attacker chosen session key. The victim might not realize they are completing an authorization flow for a different dapp origin. Condition 2 is met for any dapp that exposes such an open II authentication proxy on their domain.

Condition 4 can be satisfied by controlling a replica or boundary node which can observe the delegation in step 7. Alternatively, the delegation could leak in step 9 by using an HTTP GET parameter in an URI pointing to the IC. In such cases, if the mobile app that should receive the URI isn’t installed, the browser loads the web app by making a request to the URI. Boundary and replica nodes would again receive the delegation as part of the URI. Condition 4 can also be met if the mobile app issues a request to the IC in step 11 without verifying the delegation obtained in step 9.

Finally, condition 4 can also be satisfied if the delegation is returned insecurely from the proxy front-end to the mobile app. For example, by using Android deep links or iOS custom schemes which can be intercepted by a malicious app.


### Recommendation

Never use `agent.fetchRootKey()` in production builds, only in test builds. Not calling this method will result in the hard coded root subnet public key of the mainnet being used for signature verification, which is the desired behavior in production.
