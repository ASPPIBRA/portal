# Introduction 

The **Internet Computer** is a blockchain that enables developers, organizations, and entrepreneurs to build and deploy secure, autonomous, and tamper-proof **[canisters](/how-it-works/canister-lifecycle)**, an evolution of **smart contracts**.

As a dapp developer, you might find it useful to think of the Internet Computer as providing the following key features:

-   A **globally-accessible, public blockchain** for running smart contracts at web speed, that can serve interactive web content to users. You can read more about the [architecture of ICP](/how-it-works/architecture-of-the-internet-computer). 

-   A secure cryptographic protocol (**[Internet Computer protocol](/how-it-works/core-ic-protocol-overview)**) run by nodes machines operated by independent node providers in independent data centers all over the world. This guarantees the secure execution of smart contracts. 

-   A **network of independent blockchains**, known as [subnets](/docs/current/concepts/nodes-subnets), connected using [chain-key cryptography](/how-it-works) that can [scale out](/how-it-works/scalability) its capacity as required.
