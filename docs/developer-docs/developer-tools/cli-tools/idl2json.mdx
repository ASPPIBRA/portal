# idl2json

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate"]} />


## Overview

[`idl2json`](https://github.com/dfinity/idl2json/tree/main) is a command-line tool used to translate [Candid](https://github.com/dfinity/candid) textual values from `stdin` into JSON values outputted in `stdout`.

`idl2json` can be used in workflows where a tool producing Candid values, such as `dfx`, needs to provide JSON values to JSON-based tools.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Download and install [cargo]

Once you have downloaded cargo, install `idl2json` with the `cargo install` command:

```
cargo install idl2json_cli
```

## Usage



dfx canister call nns-dapp get_stats --network ic | idl2json | jq '.performance_counts[] | select(.name == "post_upgrade stop") | .instruction_count'

## `dfx` supported JSON output




idl2json
========

Reads  from `stdin` and emits them as json values on `stdout`.

This command is useful for piping the output of Candid value producing tools (such as dfx) into json tools.

```
dfx canister call governance get_proposal_info 1 | idl2json
```

There is sample output to play with without dfx:

```
<samples/proposal.idl ./target/debug/idl2json
```
