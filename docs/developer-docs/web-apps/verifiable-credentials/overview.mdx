# Overview

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Concept"]} />

A credential is a document or certificate that validates an individual's identity or qualifications. Credentials are a part of daily life, with common examples including:

- A driver's license that qualifies an individual to operate a motor vehicle.
- A university degree that can be used to assert a level of education.
- A government-issued passport enabling travel between countries.

These are examples of physical credentials, as they have a physical component that must be presented for validation. Credentials can also be digital, relying on authentication using certifications or digital signatures for validation, such as a username and password or ICP Internet Identity.

Verifiable credentials (VCs) are a type of digital credential that enables individuals, organizations, or things (such as devices) to cryptographically prove the claims they make about themselves.

## Benefits

Verifiable credentials are designed to be tamper-evident, privacy-preserving, and interoperable across different systems and contexts. By using verifiable credentials, you will have a mechanism to express these sorts of credentials on ICP in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy-preserving, and machine-verifiable.

## Terminology

When learning about and using VCs, there are two primary terms to familiarize yourself with:

- **Issuer**: An service or app that issues verifiable credentials to a user.

- **Relying party**: An service or app that requests users provide verifiable credentials.

## How to use VCs

To use verifiable credentials there are two workflows. First, you can [become an issuer](issuer.mdx) of verifiable credentials. By issuing verifiable credentials, you can empower users to control and share their credentials selectively, enhancing privacy and giving users greater autonomy over their digital identity.

The second workflow allows you to [become a relying party](relying-party.mdx) for verifiable credentials. By requesting verifiable credentials from your application's users or customers, you can ensure that the claims that users make are verified by parties (issuers) that you trust, while preserving the userâ€™s privacy.
