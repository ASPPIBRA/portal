# Become a relying party

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

A **relying party** is a service or app that requests a user's verifiable credentials from the [issuer](issuer.mdx) of those credentials. Relying parties use the identity provider API to communicate with the issuer using an **identity provider** such as Internet Identity. Identity providers must support the [verifiable credentials specification](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/docs/vc-spec.md). This API uses the [`window.postMessage()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) interface.

Internet Identity is used as the identity provider in this tutorial.

## Using the identity provider API

To implement a relying party service, your canister must perform three steps:

1. Load an identity provider such as Internet Identity: Open an identity provider that will act as the communication bridge between the relying party and the issuer.

2. Request credentials: Send a JSON RPC request to the issuer for a user's credentials.

3. Receive a response: Receive either a success or error message from the identity provider.

### Step 1: Load the identity provider in a new window

First, your canister must initiative and load an identity provider (in this example, Internet Identity) in a new window with the URL path `/vc-flow`. Opening this window will trigger the identity provider to load and send a notification to the [`window.postMessage()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) interface with the following JSON-RPC content:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "vc-flow-ready"
}
```

The user will interact with this window to authenticate with their Internet Identity. If this window is closed by the user or times out, the request for credentials will be closed and an error will be returned to the relying party.

### Step 2: Request a verifiable credential

Once the user has logged into Internet Identity and the service is ready, the relying party service can request a verifiable credential for a user by sending a JSON RPC request to the issuer. The user must be logged into Internet Identity for the request to be successful. Below is an example of a JSON RPC request to request a credential:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "request_credential",
  "params": {
    "issuer": {
        "origin": "https://employment-info.com",
        "canisterId": "rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai"
    },
    "credentialSpec": {
        "credentialType": "VerifiedEmployee",
        "arguments": {
          "employerName": "XYZ Ltd."
        }
    },
    "credentialSubject": "2mdal-aedsb-hlpnv-qu3zl-ae6on-72bt5-fwha5-xzs74-5dkaz-dfywi-aqe"
  }
}
```

In this request, the following parameters must be set:

- `method`: `request_credential`: Uses the method for requesting a verifiable credential.

- `params`: Configuration parameters to identify which credential is being requested.

    - `issuer`: The information to identify which issuer the request is sent to.

        - `origin`: The origin URL of the issuer.

        - `canisterId`: The canister ID of the issuer. This field is optional.

  - `credentialSpec`: The specification of the credential being requested.

    - `credentialType`: The type of the requested credential.

    - `arguments`: Arguments mapping key value pairs that are specific to the credential. This field is optional.

  - `credentialSubject`: The principal of the user requesting the credential.

  - `derivationOrigin`: An origin that should be used for principal derivation as an alternative to the client origin. This field is optional.


Additional examples can be found in the [verifiable credentials specification](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/docs/vc-spec.md#examples).

### JavaScript SDK for verifiable credentials

The [JavaScript SDK for VCs](https://github.com/dfinity/verifiable-credentials-sdk/tree/main/js-library) can be used to send these JSON RPC requests programmatically using the `requestVerifiablePresentation` function. Below is an example:

```javascript
import { requestVerifiablePresentation } from "@dfinity/verifiable-credentials/request-verifiable-presentation";

requestVerifiablePresentation({
  onSuccess: async (verifiablePresentation: VerifiablePresentationResponse) => {
    // Called when the flow finishes successfully.
  },
  onError() {
    // Called when there is a technical error.
  },
  issuerData: {
    origin: "<url of the origin>",
    canisterId: "<[optional] canister id>",
  },
  credentialData: {
    credentialSpec: {
      credentialType: '<credential type as expected by issuer>',
      arguments: {
        // Arguments to verify with the credential
      },
    },
    credentialSubject: "<user's principal>",
  },
  identityProvider: "<[optional] url identity provider>",
  derivationOrigin: "<[optional] origin for delegated identity>",
  windowOpenerFeatures: "<[optional] window opener config string>",
});
```

[Learn more about the JavaScript SDK for VCs](https://github.com/dfinity/verifiable-credentials-sdk/tree/main/js-library).

This code executes the following steps:

- Opens a new window or tab with the identity provider (Internet Identity).

- Waits for a window post message from II.

- Sends a request to II through the window post message.

- Waits for the response from the II.

- Calls an `onSuccess` callback if the process was successful, but that does necessarily mean that a credential was received.

- Calls an `onError` callback if the process has some technical error, if the user closes the II window, or if II times out.

### Step 3: Receive a response

If the JSON RPC request is successfully sent and received by the issuer, Internet Identity will return the following JSON RPC response to the relying party:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "verifiablePresentation": "eyJQ..."
  }
}
```

In this response, `verifiablePresentation`is a JWT based verifiable presentation (VP) containing two credentials:

    1. A verifiable credential issued by Internet Identity that relates the `credentialSubject` to the user principal.

    2. A verifiable credential issued by the issuer to the user principal.

The order of the credentials in the VP should match the order above, such that the credential relating to the `credentialSubject` to the user principal should come first.

[View an example of a verifiable presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#example-jwt-payload-of-a-jwt-based-verifiable-presentation-non-normative) for reference.

The relying party should not expect to receive an immediate response, as it should wait for one of the following events:

- II sends a JSON-RPC response as described above.

- II sends a JSON-RPC error response as described below.

- The user closes the II window. This should be treated as an error.

The relying party may also close the II window after some timeout. The user would then be notified by the relying party that the request failed.

### Error messages

If the workflow failed for any reason, Internet Identity will return an error. The error does not provide details on the cause of the failure for privacy protection.

An example error can be found below:

``` json
{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "error": {
        "version": "1",
        "code": "UNKNOWN"
    }
}
```

## Verifying the credentials

To verify that the credentials received are valid, the returned JWT should contain a property in `credentialSubject` named `credentialType` that contains key-value entries that list the expected arguments for the credential type. For example, if the following credential is requested:

```json
    "credentialSpec": {
        "credentialType": "VerifiedAdult",
        "arguments": {
            "minAge": 18,
    }
```

A valid issuer would return a verifiable credential that contains `credentialSubject` with a matching property and argument:

```json
    "VerifiedAdult": {
        "minAge": 18,
    }
```

Below is an example of how credentials can be verified programmatically with Rust:

```rust
#[update]
#[candid_method]
fn validate_ii_vp(req: ValidateVpRequest) -> Result<(), ContentError> {
    let (ic_root_key_raw, vc_flow_signers) = CONFIG.with_borrow(|config| {
        let config = config.get();
        let Some(issuer_canister_id) = config.issuers.get(&req.issuer_origin) else {
            return Err(ContentError::NotAuthorized(format!(
                "issuer not supported: {}",
                req.issuer_origin
            )));
        };
        if let Some(issuer_canister_id_from_req) = req.issuer_canister_id {
            if *issuer_canister_id != issuer_canister_id_from_req {
                return Err(ContentError::NotAuthorized(format!(
                    "wrong issuer canister id: expected {}, got {}",
                    issuer_canister_id, issuer_canister_id_from_req
                )));
            }
        }
        Ok((
            config.ic_root_key_raw.clone(),
            VcFlowSigners {
                ii_origin: config.ii_origin.clone(),
                ii_canister_id: config.ii_canister_id,
                issuer_origin: req.issuer_origin,
                issuer_canister_id: *issuer_canister_id,
            },
        ))
    })?;
    match validate_ii_presentation_and_claims(
        &req.vp_jwt,
        req.effective_vc_subject,
        &vc_flow_signers,
        &req.credential_spec,
        &ic_root_key_raw,
        time() as u128,
    ) {
        Ok(()) => Ok(()),
        Err(err) => Err(ContentError::NotAuthorized(format!(
            "VP validation error: {:?}",
            err
        ))),
    }
}
```
