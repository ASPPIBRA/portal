# Juno

## Overview

[Juno](https://juno.build/) is a community project that provides a blockchain-as-a-service platform designed for developers to deploy dapps without any blockchain knowledge. It features plug-and-play integration for services such as authentication, hosting, and storage. Juno is framework-agnostic, supporting integration with several different frontend frameworks.

Juno provides a way to deploy dapps onto ICP without using the traditional ICP development workflow that utilizes [`dfx`](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/install/) to create, manage, and deploy canisters.

## Using Juno

To get started with Juno, you can create your first [satellite](https://juno.build/docs/add-juno-to-an-app/create-a-satellite), a 100% on-chain smart contract container that provides secure data storage, authentication, hosting, and also supports custom domains. Juno satellite deployment and management are done through a web-based [console](https://console.juno.build/).

To integrate frameworks and packages with Juno, the [Juno SDK core library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@junobuild/core) is used. This library can be downloaded using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), then used in your local environment to integrate Juno with frameworks such as Vue, Angular, Rust, or React.
