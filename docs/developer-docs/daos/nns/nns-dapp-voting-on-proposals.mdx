## Vote on proposals

Active participation in governance is an important factor in the long-term health of the Internet Computer. Voting on proposals is also an important factor in calculating the rewards you receive in return for locking up ICP utility tokens in neurons.

However, voting directly on every proposal submitted to the NNS presents several challenges. For example, proposals might be submitted and require a vote when you are unavailable or propose changes that you lack the expertise to evaluate. To address these challenges, you can configure neurons to vote automatically to adopt or reject proposals by following the votes of a group of neurons.

To maximize your rewards, you should vote on as many proposals as possible by following the active neuron holders who have interests aligned with your own. For example, you might follow the Internet Computer Association (ICA) on some topics such **SubnetManagement** and other neuron holders on topics such as **Governance**.

You can choose the proposal types and proposal topics that you see and vote on either directly or by following other neuron stakeholders using filters in the Network Nervous System dapp. For example, if you want to review and vote on all proposals that involve network participants such as data center identities and node operators, but aren’t interested in viewing proposals related to the current market value of ICP, as measured by an International Monetary Fund (IMF) Special Drawing Right (SDR), you can select the **ParticipantManagement** topic filter and deselect the **ExchangeRate** topic filter.

To manually vote on proposals:

- #### Step 1:  From the NNS dapp, select 'Vote' from the left navigation bar.

- #### Step 2: Then, select which Nervous System you'd like to view proposals for.

By default, the Internet Computer NNS proposals are shown, but other proposals for SNS's like OpenChat and Kinic are also available.

- #### Step 3:  Click on any proposals to view more information on it, such as the proposals summary, the type of proposals, the topic, and when the proposal's voting ends.
