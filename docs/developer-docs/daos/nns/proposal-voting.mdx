# Voting on proposals

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Governance", "Concept"]} />

The NNS DAO is an open governance system where everyone can become a participant by staking some ICP in a neuron. Thus, any user can get voting rights by [staking some ICP in a neuron](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/nns-app-quickstart#stake-icp-utility-tokens-in-a-neuron) and locking the tokens for at least 6 months (called the neuron's dissolve delay).

## Finding proposals and discussions

You can see all the NNS proposals on the [Internet Computer dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance) or on the [NNS dapp](https://nns.ic0.app/). Voters can freely discuss proposal anywhere they like. A lot of NNS proposals are discussed on the [developer forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/c/roadmap/29).

## Direct voting
When a user has an eligible neuron and would like to vote on an open proposal, one option is to directly vote to adopt or reject the proposal. Currently, the most user-friendly way to first find the open proposals that a user can vote on and to then cast a vote is via the NNS Frontend dapp: https://nns.ic0.app/ as explained [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/nns-app-quickstart#vote-on-proposals).

## Liquid democracy / Following
Users may not have the time or knowledge to participate in all voting decisions. Therefore, instead of directly voting on proposals, neuron holders may choose to delegate their vote to other neurons that they trust with certain decisions. This concept of delegating the right to vote to other voters who then effectively vote with more voting power is called **liquid democracy**. In the NNS DAO, this is also called **following**, as a neuron follows the decision of some other neurons. The liquid democracy allows even neurons that do not have enough knowledge of a certain topic to participate in governance by choosing the neurons that they trust with certain decisions.

### How to follow a neuron
Concretely, proposals are grouped into different [**proposal topics**](./proposal-voting.mdx#Proposal topics and types) and following is done on a per-topic basis. Refer to [this documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/nns-app-quickstart#neuron-following) for more information about how you can set up your neuron to follow a group of other neurons.

### How to find neurons to follow
In order for some neurons to follow others, there need to be some voting neurons that can be followed.

There are two ways how neurons to follow can be found and set in a neuron:
* A user with an actively voting neuron who is offering to be followed can communicate their neuron ID to others, for example on the forum or their website. Other neurons can then [follow them](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/nns-app-quickstart#step-5-enter-a-neuron-id-to-follow-or-select-a-group-of-neurons-from-the-menu-provided) using this neuron ID.
* A user with an actively voting neuron who is offering to be followed can register a **known neuron**, also called **named neuron**, in the NNS governance canister. Neurons who would like to follow others can see a list of all registered neurons with their name and optionally a short description and can just select one of them to follow (without having to remember an ID).

## How to become a known neuron
To become a known neuron in the NNS DAO, you first need to create a neuron and then submit an NNS proposal to register the known neuron in the NNS governance.
A know neuron has a name and optionally a short description.
After registering the known neuron, it will be visible to all NNS DAO users when they set up their following.
To convince the NNS DAO to accept a new known proposal and to provide more context for potential followers, it is
often useful for known neuron candidates to present themselves to the community already before submitting the proposal.

### Create a neuron - overview
There are multiple options how to create and set up a neuron that is then registered as a know neuron.
A known neuron can be operated by an individual person or an organization where one person controls the neuron
or it can be operated by a group of people.
Depending on this, different neuron creation options might be more suitable.

### Create a neuron controlled by one party

If you would like to create a known neuron that is operated by one party that knows the neuron's controlling key and can change the neuron, you can use one of the following options:
* [Create the neuron on the NNS dapp](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/nns-app-quickstart#stake-icp-utility-tokens-in-a-neuron).
* [Create the neuron on the NNS dapp but controlled by a hardware ledger wallet](https://support.dfinity.org/hc/en-us/articles/8760495850900-How-do-I-use-my-Ledger-Nano-with-the-Internet-Computer)
* [Create the neuron via the quill command line tool](https://support.dfinity.org/hc/en-us/articles/4408752586260-What-is-Quill)

:::info
If there are multiple people involved a know neuron's voting decision, the known neuron can be set up to follow their individual neurons
 on the topics that it should vote on.
Note however that for a neuron which is created this way the **person who created the neuron has the controlling key**.
This means that this person can modify the neuron and, in particular, can also vote in the name of the neuron without taking the input of others into account.
This can be suitable for individuals who operate a known neuron or for organizations where one person is trusted with this task.

:::

### Create a community neuron
To prevent the required trust mentioned above, you can also set up a **community neuron** that is operated by a group and
 where no single member can change the neuron without agreement from others.
Once a community neuron is created, a natural voting setup for it is to follow multiple neurons controlled by community members;
 the community neuron then votes like the majority of the individual neurons it follows.
 This setup is also used, for example in DFINITYâ€™s neurons.

### Create a community neuron controlled by a canister
A neuron's controller is a principal derived from a cryptographic key; at the moment canisters cannot directly control neurons.
But canisters can hold cryptographic keys by canister signatures or ECDSA signatures.
Together with the HTTP requests for canisters, those enable a canister to send signed ingress messages to the IC, and thereby control a neuron.
It is currently [discussed on the forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reevaluating-neuron-control-restrictions/28597/240) whether the restriction that canisters cannot
 directly control neurons should be lifted. In turn the rewards for canister-controlled neurons might be decreased in the future.

Of course, a neuron controlled by a canister is only as decentralized as the canister.
But the canister controlling a community neuron could be blackholed or controlled by an [SNS DAO](./sns/overview).
All in all, this method of controlling a neuron seems can be promising to essentially creating a neuron controlled by a DAO.

### Create a community neuron controlled by neuron management proposals
A neuron can be configured through neuron management proposals, which are voted on by a set of designated followee neurons.
Neuron management proposals can make the neuron vote and configure the neuron, but not disburse it.

To manage a neuron through neuron management proposals, that target neuron must be set up to follow other neurons on the `ManageNeuron` topic.
The neuron is controlled by the followee neurons through a proposal process that resembles the usual voting process on the NNS, with the following differences:
* For a proposal to manage a neuron, only the followees of that neuron on the ManageNeuron topic are eligible to vote.
* The proposal passes if a strict majority of the followees approves.
* Each proposal costs 0.01 ICP, there is no distinction between successful and failed proposals.
* The voting period is 12h.
* No rewards are paid for voting on neuron management proposals.

There are ManageNeuron proposal for each operation that a neuron controller can execute on a neuron, with two exceptions:
`disburse` and `disburse_to_neuron`.

The neuron management mechanism is mature and has been used by DFINITY since the launch of the ICP.
There are a few things, though, that need clarification and are covered next:
* How to create a neuron without a controller so that is is _only_ controlled by group decision making.
* How to configure the neuron via proposals.

:::info
Note that since the neuron does not have a controller and neither `ManageNeuron` proposals nor hotkeys can be used to disburse a neuron, the stake will be locked in the neuron indefinitely.

:::

The following steps make use of two tools: [quill]() [ic-repl]().
Both tools support cold-storage setup for added security. The commands shown here use a simplified setup working directly on a machine connected to the Internet.



### Create a community neuron controlled by neuron hotkeys
A community neuron can also be set up by creating a neuron without a controller (similar to the setup for neuron management proposals),
 and with a canister ID acting as a hotkey that can be used for voting.
 The complexity of this method is similar to decentralized control, as the hotkey canister will have to be controlled in a decentralized manner.

### Present your neuron to the community
Often the owners of known neurons use the description part to present themselves a little.
There are no rules of course, but it can also make sense for neuron owners to present themselves to the community outside of a proposal.
This can, for example, be done with a forum post or by sharing information on social media, such as OpenChat or X.
It might be useful to share the following information with others, so that followers can make well-informed decisions who to follow for which topic:
* **Who you are**: Name of the person or group and their relationship to the ICP.
* **Neuron control**: How controls the neuron? Does it have a single controller or can it only be changed by a group of people?
* **Neuron settings**: How is the neuron set up? How many ICP are staked and what dissolve delay is set? For example by increasing the dissolve delay, known neurons may indicate to potential followers that they have some committed to the ICP.
* **Covered topics**: A description of what topics the known neuron will vote on. Does the neuron commit to always vote on these topics?
Since following is done based on proposal topics, this is relevant information for followers.
Usually, neurons would want to follow other neurons neurons that always vote on a given topic in order not to miss out on [voting rewards](./staking-voting-rewards.mdx).
* **Depth of reviews**: A description of how the known neuron plans to verify proposals. To which depth will it review the code or the content of the proposal and how is this done?
* **Following setting**: For the topics where the know neuron does not vote directly, who does the neuron follow?
* **Voting principles**: What are the principles according to which you plan to vote.
* **Link to the neuron ID / proposal**: If you already created the neuron, you may want to provide its ID or even link to a dashboard where it can be inspected. The same holds for the proposal to register it as a know neuron in the case where the proposal was already made.

:::info
There are no rules how a know neuron has to vote. However, due to the above reasons, it might be useful for known neurons to **focus on fewer topics and commit to always vote on those** rather than trying to cover a lot of topics and vote less reliably. For example, they could become experts on some proposal topics. If a known neuron commits to always vote on a certain topic it might be more likely that others follow the neuron on this topic as the followers want to make sure they are not missing out on rewards.

### Register the known neuron
To register a neuron as a know neuron, you need to submit a NNS proposal. The proposal can be submitted by any neuron that has has at least 10 ICP staked.
