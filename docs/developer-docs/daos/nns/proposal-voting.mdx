# Voting on proposals

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Governance", "Concept"]} />

The NNS DAO is an open governance system where everyone can become a participant by staking some ICP in a neuron.
Thus, any user can get voting rights by [staking some ICP in a neuron](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/nns-app-quickstart#stake-icp-utility-tokens-in-a-neuron) and locking the tokens for at least 6 months (called the neuron's dissolve delay).

## Finding proposals and discussions

You can see all the NNS proposals on the [Internet Computer dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance) or on the [NNS dapp](https://nns.ic0.app/).
Voters can freely discuss proposal anywhere they like. A lot of NNS proposals are discussed on the [developer forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/c/roadmap/29).

## Direct voting
When a user has an eligible neuron and would like to vote on an open proposal, one option is to directly vote to adopt or reject the proposal. Currently, the most user-friendly way to first find the open proposals that a user can vote on and to then cast a vote is via the NNS Frontend dapp: https://nns.ic0.app/ as explained [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/nns-app-quickstart#vote-on-proposals).

## Liquid democracy / Following
Users may not have the time or knowledge to participate in all voting decisions.
Therefore, instead of directly voting on proposals, neuron holders may choose to delegate their vote to other neurons that
 they trust with certain decisions. This concept of delegating the right to vote to other voters who then effectively vote
 with more voting power is called **liquid democracy**.
 In the NNS DAO, this is also called **following**, as a neuron follows the decision of some other neurons.
 The liquid democracy allows even neurons that do not have enough knowledge of a certain topic to participate
 in governance by choosing the neurons that they trust with certain decisions.

### How to follow a neuron
Concretely, proposals are grouped into different [**proposal topics**](./proposal-voting.mdx#Proposal topics and types) and following is done on a per-topic basis.
Refer to [this documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/nns-app-quickstart#neuron-following) for more information about how you can set up your neuron to follow a group of other neurons.

### How to find neurons to follow
In order for some neurons to follow others, there need to be some voting neurons that can be followed.
There are at least two ways how neurons to follow can be found and set in a neuron:
* A user with an actively voting neuron who is offering to be followed can communicate their neuron ID to others, for example on the forum or their website. Other neurons can then [follow them](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/nns-app-quickstart#step-5-enter-a-neuron-id-to-follow-or-select-a-group-of-neurons-from-the-menu-provided) using this neuron ID.
* A user with an actively voting neuron who is offering to be followed can register a **known neuron**, also called **named neuron**, in the NNS governance canister. Neurons who would like to follow others can see a list of all registered neurons with their name and optionally a short description and can just select one of them to follow (without having to remember an ID).

### How to become a known neuron

Create a neuron: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/nns-app-quickstart#stake-icp-utility-tokens-in-a-neuron
Register your neuron as a known neurons with a name and a description

- Submit a proposal:

voting is then as with any other neuron
