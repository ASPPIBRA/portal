The Network Nervous System, NNS for short, is the fully on-chain decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that governs the full Internet Computer.
It is a stake-based, open governance system where everyone can participate by staking some ICP utility tokens.

## The need for the NNS
The Internet Computer is run by a lot of independent node machines that run the Internet Computer protocol and are organized into different sub-groups, called subnets.
To ensure that the Internet Computer can evolve in terms of security, efficiency, and scale, there needs to be a mechanisms to make decisions such as
* when new nodes should be added for more robustness.
* when new subnets should be added to scale the Internet Computer and which nodes should be in which subnet.
* when the Internet Computer protocol should be updated to a new version, for example for added security or better performance.

The NNS ensures that all these decisions can be made in a decentralized and autonomous way.

## Neurons
On the Internet Computer, governance participants are called _neurons_.
Neurons are staked ICP tokens, so anyone can become a part of the NNS governance by staking ICP tokens in a neuron.
This is incentivized by voting rewards for neurons who participate in decision making.

For a tutorial on how to stake tokens in a neuron, refer to the [Staking a neuron](/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/nns-dapp-staking-a-neuron).
For more background information on neurons and voting rewards, refer to [Neurons](/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/neurons-overview).


## Proposals
Suggestions how to evolve ICP (as mentioned above).
Neurons can submit and vote on proposals

Participants submit proposals to the NNS. Refer to the proposal submission requirements and types at [proposal requirements](/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/proposal-requirements).

Proposals are adopted or rejected based on voting activity by “neurons” that network participants have created.


## Voting and proposal lifecycle
1. Proposal submission:
Someone submits proposal, e.g, to update protocol

2. Ballot roll with VP
governance takes snapshot of VP and reserves ballots
VP depending on stake and how long tokens are locked for

3. Voting
others vote (w/ voting power)
can vote directly or follow others in liquid democracy

Neurons can manually vote on all proposals.

If they cannot manually vote on all proposals due to high submission volumes or a lack of expertise, neurons can delegate their vote, called _following_, for specific proposal topic. This ensures efficient decision-making without requiring constant manual input.


4. proposal decision
Propoal decision

standard majority
voting period
50% of voted
3% of total (to ensure people care)

immediate majority


A proposal passes based on either:
- **Absolute Majority** - At any point, even before the voting period ends, if an absolute majority (more than half of the total voting power) has voted "yes," then the proposal is adopted. If an absolute majority has voted "no," then the proposal is rejected.

- **Simple Majority** - When the voting period ends, if a simple majority (more than half of the cast votes) has voted "yes" and the number of these yes votes constitutes at least 3% of the total voting power, then the proposal is adopted. Otherwise, the proposal is rejected.

For determining how long proposals are open for voting, the governance uses a so called "Wait-for-quiet" algorithm. This ensures that proposals are decided quickly if all voters agree, but have a longer voting period if they are controversial. Most proposals start with 4 days of voting period that can be extended up to 8 days.
Once a proposal is adopted, it is autonomously executed on-chain.
