========================================
# OLD CONTENT TO ADD HERE
When a user creates a neuron, the staked ICP can only be taken out of the neuron again by disbursing the neuron.
Each neuron is configured with a “dissolve delay” that determines the minimum amount of time that you have to wait before you can unlock your staked ICP utility tokens.
Once a neuron has been placed into “dissolving mode,” its dissolve delay falls over time, rather like a kitchen timer, until it reaches zero, whereupon its owner can perform
a final disburse action to unlock the balance of ICP.

Neurons with a longer dissolve delay have more voting power and get more rewards so that they are economically incentivized to vote in the best long-term interests of the network.

The number of rewards that neuron receives derive from factors as the amount of staked tokens, the lockup period remaining (the “dissolve delay”), the neuron’s “age”, the proportion of possible votes it has participated in, and the sum of voting activity across all neurons, since the overall total rewards are capped and must be divided between voters.
