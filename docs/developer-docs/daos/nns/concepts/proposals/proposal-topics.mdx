# Proposal details

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Governance", "Concept"]} />


## Proposal fields

Each proposal submitted to the NNS has the following fields:

* **Summary**: Text providing a short description of the proposal using a maximum of 280 bytes.

* **URL**: The web address of additional content required to evaluate the proposal, specified using HTTPS. For example, the URL's content might describe supporting the assignment of a DCID (data center ID) to a new data center.

* **Proposer**: The ID of the neuron that submitted the proposal. When a proposal is submitted, a “charge” is placed on its balance in case it is rejected. The balance needs to be enough to pay the charge on all rejection(s). The NNS requires a neuron to have a dissolve delay of ≥ 6 months to vote, which also applies to submitting proposals.

* **Proposal type**: The type of the proposal determines the function that will process the proposal if it is adopted, and the type and structure of the parameters that will be passed to that function. The type also infers what topic a proposal belongs to, which is used for [following](./direct-voting).

* **Parameters**: The parameters that will be passed to the system function and invoked if the proposal is adopted, as determined by its type. When a proposal is submitted, the NNS checks these parameters.

The NNS assigns a unique identity to each proposal that it receives.

## Proposal topics and types

Each proposal has a **proposal type**, which determines what happens if the proposal is adopted or rejected. This defines which canister method is invoked with which arguments.
Each type of proposal belongs to a specific **proposal topic**. Topics are used for [following]
(/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/concepts/neurons/neuron-following) and also determine some other details about
how the proposal is processed. For example, the voting period and the voting reward weight are defined per topic.

We present the proposals grouped by their topics, with the corresponding proposal types that they contain.


### Topic: `ProtocolCanisterManagement`
All proposals to manage [protocol canisters](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/system
-canisters/), which are considered part of the Internet Computer protocol and are essential for its proper functioning.
This includes the NNS DAO canisters, such as NNS governance, NNS root, the registry canister, and the ICP ledger
canister.

* `InstallCode`: Install, reinstall or upgrade the code of a canister that is controlled by the NNS.
* `UpdateCanisterSettings`: Update the settings of a canister that is controlled by the NNS.
* `StopOrStartCanister`: Stop or start a canister that is controlled by the NNS.
* `HardResetNnsRootToVersion`: Uninstall and install root with the Wasm provided in the function.  If `InitArgs` are provided, they will be passed to the `canister_init` function of the Wasm provided. This function is meant as a 'break glass' mechanism for when an open call context in the root canister is preventing root or another canisters from upgrading.



### Topic: `ServiceNervousSystemManagement`
All proposals to manage the canisters of service nervous systems (SNS), including upgrading relevant canisters and managing SNS framework canister WASMs through SNS-W.

*  `InstallCode`, `UpdateCanisterSettings`, and `StopOrStartCanister` are the same as in topic
`ProtocolCanisterManagement` only targeting different canisters.
* `AddSnsWasm`: Add a new SNS canister Wasm to SNS-W. All SNS DAOs can then upgrade to new versions along the upgrade path defined in [SNS-W](/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/overview#SNS-W).
* `InsertSnsWasmUpgradePathEntries`: Insert custom upgrade path entries into SNS-W for all SNSes, or for an SNS specified by its governance canister ID.


### Topic: `ApplicationCanisterManagement`
All proposals to manage NNS-controlled canisters not covered by other topics (Protocol Canister Management or Service Nervous System Management).

*  `InstallCode`, `UpdateCanisterSettings`, and `StopOrStartCanister` are the same as in topics
`ProtocolCanisterManagement` and `ServiceNervousSystemManagement` only targeting different canisters.

The following proposal type is specific for the Bitcoin canister:
* `BitcoinSetConfig`: A proposal to set the configuration of the underlying Bitcoin Canister that powers the Bitcoin API. The configuration includes whether or not the Bitcoin Canister should sync new blocks from the network, whether the API is enabled, the fees to charge, etc.
