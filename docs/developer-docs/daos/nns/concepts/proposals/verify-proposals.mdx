# Verifying proposals

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Governance", "Concept"]} />

The NNS is the decentralized governance system that governs the full Internet Computer. The decentralized nature of
the NNS is one of the key factors for the Internet Computer's security - it ensures that there is no single point of
failure.
Therefore it is important that proposals are verified by as many governance participants as possible.
According to the decentralized nature, each neuron verifying a proposal can define their own criteria for when a
proposal should be adopted or rejected. This provides some inputs that can be considered in this process.decentralized

The community is encouraged to discuss proposals and their verification on the [developer forum](https://forum
.dfinity.org/), using the category `Governance` with sub-category `NNS proposal discussion` and using the proposalâ€™s
topic as a tag.

You can also consider the following information for proposals submitted by the DFINITY foundation:

* Each proposal submitted by the DFINITY foundation has a corresponding post on the forum (see [example](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-elect-new-release-rc-2024-05-01-23-01/30247)). Relevant posts can be found under the `Governance` category with the tags `replica` and `release`.
* The relevant code is available in [this repository](https://github.com/dfinity/ic).
* To verify that the code in the proposal is built from the specified `git commit`, follow the instructions in the [README file of the IC repository](https://github.com/dfinity/ic#verifying-releases).
* Each proposal summary includes instructions for verifying the proposal payload. See this [example](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/130083). These steps are tested on Ubuntu 22.04, which is the recommended operating system for the verification process.

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#verifying-releases
sudo apt-get install -y curl && curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/ec35ebd252d4ffb151d2cfceba3a86c4fb87c6d6/gitlab-ci/tools/repro-check.sh && chmod +x repro-check.sh && ./repro-check.sh -c ec35ebd252d4ffb151d2cfceba3a86c4fb87c6d6
```

* The reproducibility check script is versioned, cryptographically checksummed, and open-sourced, ensuring it cannot change post-submission. The proposal summary is immutable after submission. The upgrade image contents are cryptographically checksummed, and the checksum is included in the proposal payload and verified during the upgrade process.
* For GuestOS, DFINITY aims for a weekly release cycle, resulting in approximately one proposal per week plus additional feature builds.
* For HostOS, there is no fixed release cycle, but an upgrade is typically proposed every 3-6 months.


## Participant management proposals
If you are looking to verify [participant management proposals](/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/concepts/proposals/proposal-topics#Topic:-`ParticipantManagement`),
these are some steps you can consider for verification.

### Add or remove node providers
 For proposals that add or remove node providers, you can check that
 * there is a proper forum introduction by the new NP
 * self-declaration and Identity documents are uploaded on the wiki
 * hashes of the self-declaration and identity document match the hashes in the proposal
 * if this is a new region or community, that there is an entry in the public chamber of commerce register  (if chamber
  of commerce number is provided)

### Add or remove Data Centers
For proposals that add or remove data centers, you can
  * check who submitted the proposal (normally only a new node provider)
  * perform an Internet search whether this is a legitimate data center.

## Verify Node Admin proposals
If you are looking to verify [node admin proposals](/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/concepts/proposals/proposal-topics#Topic:-`NodeAdmin`),
these are some steps you can consider for verification.

### Update node configuration
In such a proposal, a node provider sets the number of nodes and the `node_type` (Gen1, Gen2).
You can
* check these against the originally approved node allowance (whether that allowance was approved, and whether it
matches the IC Target topology using the [github tooling](https://github.com/StephanusFischer/decentralization)

### Add node operator
 This proposal sets the allowance for a particular node provider in a specific data center.
 You can perform the following checks
 * if it matches the IC Target topology using the [github tooling](https://github
 .com/StephanusFischer/decentralization). For example, such proposals should be rejected if the target topology has
 been reached.
 * whether the node provider-id and data center-id match with the previously submitted proposals (the add node provider proposal, and the add data center proposal).

### Remove nodes from the network
 This is a proposal to remove (unhealthy) nodes from the network.
 You can
 * check whether the nodes are indeed unassigned and not in a particular subnet.


## Verify Subnet management proposals
If you are looking to verify [subnet management proposals](/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/concepts/proposals/proposal-topics#Topic:-`SubnetManagement`), these are some steps you can consider for verification.

### Node replacement proposals
 For these proposals you can
 * check whether the nodes are replaced because they are dead/unhealthy or replaced for other good reasons.

### Other proposals of this topic
You can
 * check whether the reasoning in the proposal makes sense wrt which proposals need to be adopted in which order.

### Bitcoin canister upgrades
Please refer to the [Bitcoin canister documentation](https://github.com/dfinity/bitcoin-canister/blob/master/README
.md) for more information about the Bitcoin canister.

* You can find the code for the Bitcoin canister in [the `bitcoin-canister` repository](https://github.com/dfinity/bitcoin-canister).
* These proposals are not expected to happen frequently, but rather when there are important updates to be applied to the Bitcoin canister. You can expect that a new release will be cut in preparation of an upgrade in the above repository. See this [example release](https://github.com/dfinity/bitcoin-canister/releases/tag/release%2F2024-04-26).
* There are 2 Bitcoin canisters, one following the Bitcoin testnet and one following the Bitcoin mainnet network. The proposals will be specific to one of these canisters. Typically, you can expect that the proposal to upgrade the Bitcoin testnet canister happens 1 week before the one to upgrade the Bitcoin mainnet canister.
* You can find the instructions on how to verify that the Wasm in the proposal was indeed built from the provided `git commit` in the proposal's section "How can I verify the Wasm hash of this canister?" (see [this example proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/129499)).
