# Overview

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Governance", "Concept"]} />

A proposal is a suggestion for a change to the Internet Computer protocol. The NNS is an open governance system where anyone can become a participant. NNS DAO participants can submit proposals, make suggestions on how the ICP should evolve, and vote on proposals that others have submitted.

Based on the majority decision, a proposal is then adopted or rejected. If a proposal is adopted, it is automatically executed fully on-chain, without the need for manual intervention.

More technically, to participate in the NNS governance, users can stake some ICP tokens in a neuron. At least 1 ICP are required to create a neuron.

If a neuron has more than 6 months dissolve delay, it is eligible to participate in voting. This means that it can both submit and vote on proposals.



# OLD CONTENT TO ADD HERE SOMEWHERE
While other blockchains take weeks or months to upgrade and typically require substantial manual work and coordination to do so, ICP upgrades itself every week (https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/releases). Its ability to upgrade and iterate is a comparative "superpower."
