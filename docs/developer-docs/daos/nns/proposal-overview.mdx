# Overview

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Governance", "Concept"]} />

A proposal is a suggestion for a change to the Internet Computer protocol.
As the NNS is an open governance system where anyone can become a participant.
NNS DAO participants can submit proposals an thereby make suggestions on how the ICP should evolve and they can vote on proposals that other submitted.
Based on the majority decision, a proposal is then adopted or rejected.
If a proposal is adopted, it is automatically executed fully on-chain, without the need for manual intervention.

More technically, to participate in governance users can stake some ICP in a neuron (at least 1 ICP are required to create a neuron).
If a neuron has more than 6 months dissolve delay, it is eligible to participate in voting.
This means that it can both submit and vote on proposals.
