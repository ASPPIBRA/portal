# Ledger integration options

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate"  ]} />

Developers have several options for integrating with the ICP or ICRC-1 ledgers. They can use either the ICRC Rosetta or ICP Rosetta implementations, which is commonly recommended, it might be useful for certain workflows  to directly integrate with these ledgers. This section will describe what a direct integration means, how it can be achieved, and how it differs to using Rosetta.

# ICP architecture overview 

The ICP network comprises a set of (communicating) blockchains that we call subnets. Each of these blockchains hosts a number of smart contracts, called canisters. Communication with the Internet Computer uses the Internet Computer Protocol. The protocol specifies how external parties can call into canisters and how to verify the results. Verification on the internet computer does not use the concept of a validator, and it does not require running a full node. Instead, output visible to the external world is digitally signed and can be verified using the master key of the internet computer. 

Tokens on ICP are managed by smart contracts. The ICP ledger canister manages the list of balances for ICP tokens and implements methods for transferring tokens. It builds a chain of blocks consisting of all ICP token transactions since genesis. The chain is authenticated by having the ICP sign the tip of the chain. External parties can retrieve this chain and verify it is genuine by:
- Verifying the signature which requires the public key of ICP.
- Verifying that the blocks are properly chained, that is, each block contains the hash of the preceding block. Changing the chaining by some malicious party requires breaking the hash function.

:::info 
Smart contract tokens other than ICP, e.g. ckBTC or CHAT, follow the ICRC suite of standards (ICRC-1, ICRC-3, etc) and can be integrated in the similar manner as the main ICP token. For differences in detail, see below.
:::

*Note about subnet blockchain vs token ledger blockchain*: Notice the difference between the blockchain used by the subnets to agree on what the smart contract on that subnet execute (this is not relevant for integration) and the blockchain constructed locally by the ICP Ledger canister (this blockchain allows for fast retrieval & verification of the entire token transaction history.) 
The transactions that are executed by the Internet Computer, overall, are reported on the dashboard under the [Transactions panel](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/) (the panel distinguishes between update and query calls). The ICP transactions, i.e. the transactions executed by the ICP ledger appear on the dashboard under the [ICP tab](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/transactions). 

![IC Architecture](ic_architecture.png)

The left side of the picture represents an IC subnet. The subnet implements a replicated state machine: each node in the subnet hosts a copy of the subnet state (the subnet state is comprised of the states of multiple smart contracts hosted by the subnet). To maintain the state of the of the different nodes in sync, the nodes run a consensus protocol to determine what calls to execute.
The right is a schematic representation of the ICP Ledger canister. The canister builds maintains in its memory a blockchain of all ICP transactions. Each block in the chain holds one ICP transaction and the hash of the previous block.

*Note about transaction validation and full nodes*: unlike on the vast majority of other blockchains, completely validating token transactions does not require a full node. In fact, full nodes are not used for transaction validation. This is because ICP is a decentralized cloud platform, full nodes provide the cloud runtime environment, and transaction validation is done using the internet computer’s public key.

# Types of integration
There are two ways to integrate with ICP tokens. 
*Direct integration* requires an integration layer that calls directly into the Internet Computer. For the internet computer, submitting messages does not require running a node; all of the communication uses publicly available url’s and can be validated using the public key of the Internet Computer. This type of integration requires familiarity with ICP API and the ICP Ledger API. There are API libraries for JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust, Java, C, C++, and Go.
![Direct Integration](direct_integration.png)
For direct integration one needs to provide an integration layer which interacts with ICP smart contracts via the ICP API. To support ICP tokens, the integration layer needs to call into the ICP Ledger canister to issue & retrieve transactions. There is no need to run a full (or light) node to monitor the results. Instead, the ICP protocols signs relevant pieces of data using the secret key sk & chain key cryptography; the integration layer can verify cryptographically that the responses are genuine using the public key of the internet computer, pk.

- **Rosetta integration**: Requires running an instance of a Rosetta node within the trust domain of an integrator. This is an abstraction layer that hides the ICP network and ledger canister APIs. Interaction with the Rosetta node follows the [Rosetta API standard](https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/rosetta/docs/welcome) proposed and maintained by Coinbase. 
The Rosetta node fetches & verifies the ICP token transaction chain and makes it available through the Rosetta API. 

The Rosetta node can be run in a docker container. It requires IPv6 connectivity, and minimal compute, RAM and disk requirements (10 GB disk space atm). The fastest space growth was in December ’23 during an ICP inscription event – the size of the local storage grew by about 5GB within 2 weeks. 
![Rosetta Integration](rosetta_integration.png)
The Rosetta node is a server which offers as interface the Rosetta API, an API standardised by Coinbase. The Rosetta node translates calls to its API into calls to the ICP Ledger. In addition, it permanently syncs with the ICP ledger by downloading and verifying the ICP token transaction ledger. It offers endpoints for searching for transactions & blocks in the downloaded chain. 

## Direct integration
Direct integration is supported by libraries for Rust and Typescript, but proficient use of these tools would require familiarity with the following concepts:

- The distinction between update calls and query calls.
- Reading the result of update calls.
- Deduplication guarantees of ICP.
- Ingress message lifecycle.
- How to verify the result of calls to canisters.
- API of the token canister(s) and their semantics.
- Deduplication guarantees by the ledger.
- How to fetch the token ledger and verify it is genuine.
- CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation).
- Candid (ICP’s interface description language).

To implement a direct integration, you will need to:

- [Call a method of a canister](#http-call-overview): Calling canister methods is done by constructing a message which specifies among other things the canister, the method and its parameters, and submitting this message to the network. 

- Make a call to a canister: To interact with a canister on the Internet Computer, an ingress message is constructed. This message specifies the target canister, the method to be invoked, and the call's payload. Additional parameters include an ingress expiration time, an optional nonce, and the caller's principal identifier. The API of most canisters, including token ledgers, are defined using a [Candid Interface Definition Language (IDL)](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/candid/candid-concepts). Calls can be executed either replicated, or non-replicated, depending on the endpoint where they are submitted. 

- Read the result of a replicated call: The outcome of a replicated call's execution is temporarily stored in the public ingress history of the respective subnet. To access the result, a read state request is submitted, including the previously generated request ID. Given the asynchronous nature of this execution, results must be actively polled. Results are maintained in the ingress history for a brief period (5 minutes post-execution). Therefore, canisters may provide alternative methods for result retrieval that access the canister's internal state directly, such as ledger canisters offering transaction history and balance book access.
### Calling a method on an ICP canister 
A detailed description of how to use the API of the Internet Computer is included in this [section](#http-call-overview) of the Internet Computer Specification. Here we provide an overview:
Calling canister methods is done by constructing a message which specifies among other things the canister, the method and its parameters, and submitting this message to the network.  
Depending on how they are submitted, these calls are executed either replicated (by all nodes in the subnet) or unreplicated (only by one node in the subnet).  This represents a trade-off. Replicated calls are secure because tampering with the result requires tampering with a majority of nodes in the subnet. We call these “update calls”. However, replicated calls are slower since they involve running a consensus protocol on the input, and certifying the output. These calls are asynchronous.  The call is submitted to the Internet Computer and the result can only be read, by making an additional call, after the Internet Computer has certified the output. 
Non-replicated calls or “query calls” are executed by a single node in the network. Execution can therefore be synchronous, thus much faster. Because a single node is involved in the execution, the result should not be trusted (since the node can be malicious). Nonetheless, one can build trust in the results of query calls via certificates (signatures) which the ICP network can produce. For example, the hash of the last block in the ICP ledger comes with such a certificate which can be verified using the public key of the ICP network. Together with checking the correct chaining of transactions within the ICP ledger, this guarantees that the chain of transactions fetched via queries is indeed genuine. The details of how the certificates are produced and can be verified are in this companion document [here](/docs/references/http-gateway-protocol-spec). 

#### Making a call to a canister
To interact with a canister on the Internet Computer, an ingress message is constructed. This message specifies the target canister, the method to be invoked, and the call's payload. Additional parameters include an ingress expiration time, an optional nonce, and the caller's principal identifier. The API of most canisters, including token ledgers, are defined using a [Candid Interface Definition Language (IDL)](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/candid/candid-concepts). For example, the [ICP Ledger canister's Candid interface](http://rs/rosetta-api/icp_ledger/ledger.did) demonstrates this. Candid encodes the payloads, and the entire message is serialized with CBOR. A unique request ID is generated by hashing this message, which is then signed with a digital key under the ECDSA or Ed25519 schemes, identifying the caller. These ingress messages, along with their signed request IDs, are submitted to the internet computer via a REST API.
As explained above, calls can be executed either replicated, or non-replicated, depending on the endpoint where they are submitted. 

#### Reading the result of a replicated call
The outcome of a replicated call's execution is temporarily stored in the public ingress history of the respective subnet. To access the result, a read state request is submitted, including the previously generated request ID. Given the asynchronous nature of this execution, results must be actively polled. It's worth noting that results are maintained in the ingress history for a brief period (5 minutes post-execution). Therefore, canisters may provide alternative methods for result retrieval that access the canister's internal state directly, such as ledger canisters offering transaction history and balance book access.

#### Support and libraries

The Internet Computer supports interactions with ICP canisters through official JavaScript/TypeScript ([agent-js](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js)) and Rust ([agent-rs](https://docs.rs/ic-agent/latest/ic_agent/)) libraries. Additionally, third-party libraries exist for other languages like Java, C, C++, and Go.

### Ledger canister API
The API for ledger canisters is generally standardized, following the [ICRC-1 standard](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/icrc-3/standards/ICRC-1/README.md) for basic token transfers across the Internet Computer. All tokens adhering to this standard implement it. The [ICRC-3 standard](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/icrc-3/standards/ICRC-3) further elaborates on how to fetch and verify the authenticity of the transaction chain maintained by canisters, ensuring integrity and trustworthiness in transactions.

## Rosetta node integration 
The Rosetta node acts as a bridge between the Rosetta API specification by Coinbase and the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), translating API calls to ICP requests. It can be deployed locally, including in Docker, offering an HTTP REST API interface. This node also fetches and verifies ICP transaction chains, storing data in a SQL database that's accessible both through the Rosetta API and directly with SQL tools.

:::info
DFINITY does not operate Rosetta nodes for the ICP community, and as of now there are no known third party providers. The Rosetta node should run within the trust domain of an integrator.
:::

The ICP Rosetta node consists of two main parts: integration with the ICP Ledger, compliant with the Coinbase API, and Governance integration. It operates in two modes:
- Online mode: Interacts with the ICP for real-time operations like checking account balances and submitting transactions.
- Offline mode: Used for transaction signing without an internet connection, suitable for securely signing transactions with private keys from cold storage.
