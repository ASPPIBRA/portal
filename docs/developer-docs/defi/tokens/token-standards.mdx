### Basic properties for ICP utility tokens

The ICP token is similar to utility tokens governing decentralized networks such as Bitcoin, but also differs in important ways.

The ICP token is similar to Bitcoin in the following ways:

-   Each ICP token is divisible 10^8 times.

-   All transactions are stored in the ledger starting with the genesis initial state.

-   Tokens are entirely fungible.

-   `AccountIdentifier`s are 32 bytes and are roughly the equivalent of the hash of a public key, optionally together with some additional sub-account specifier.

The ICP token differs from Bitcoin in the following ways:

-   Rather than using proof of work, staked participant nodes use a variant of threshold BLS signatures to agree on a valid state of the chain.

-   Any transaction can store an 8-byte memo — this memo field is used by the Rosetta API to store the nonce that distinguishes between transactions. However, other uses for the field are possible.

## ICP Rosetta implementation

- [ICP Rosetta data API](/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/data_api/)

- [ICP Rosetta construction API](/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/construction_api/)

ICP tokens are the network's native token and can be used for several network utility actions, such as:

- Being converted into [cycles] to pay for a canister's resources and deployment.

- Being staked in a neuron to receive voting power in the [NNS].
