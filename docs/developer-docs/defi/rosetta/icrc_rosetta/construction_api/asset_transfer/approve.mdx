# Approve a spender

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial" ]} />

## Overview

This section will show you how to use ICRC Rosetta to authorize a spender to spend your ICRC-1 tokens. Make sure you are familiar with the [flow of operations](/docs/developer-docs/defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/construction_api/operations_flow/index.mdx) for Rosetta.  
The request type that is used for making direct transfers is `APPROVE` and `SPENDER`. In the simplest form it consists of two operations, one for the the approve operation and another for the spender operation. 
Note that you do not have to specify the `FEE` operation although the `FEE` of the ICRC-1 ledger Rosetta is connected to will deduct the `FEE` automatically. 
To keep an overview of all the expenses it thus may pay off to include a `FEE` operation to not overlook unexpected debit operations. 

The minimum set of operations that is sent to the `construction/payloads` endpoint is the following. 
In this case we are approving the principal `xmiu5-jqaaa-aaaag-qbz7q-cai` to spend up to 10 e8 ckBTC from principal `iowfl-yzooa-br3dt-77erl-nlm7f-kplhq-php75-hw3an-aeqn2-swh4t-3qe`.

TODO!!!

```bash
curl --location '0.0.0.0:8082/construction/payloads'  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data

```

An example implementation of a transfer may look like the following. 
Example call.
```bash
python3 icp_rosetta_client.py -k ~/.config/dfx/identity/default/identity.pem -u http://127.0.0.1:8082 -s ckBTC -d 8
```
```python
