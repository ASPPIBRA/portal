# Stake ICP

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial" ]} />

## Overview
This section of the staking tuorial will show you how to use the ICP that was previously sent to the governance account identifier that corresponds to your
public key to create a neuron and fund the neuron with ICP. 
The ICP that was sent to this governance account identifier will be used to create a neuron or add the ICP to an already existing neuron. Either way the full amount of ICP that was
sent to the governance account identifier will be used for staking.

The call to the endpoint `construction/payloads` will look something like the following.

```bash
curl --location '0.0.0.0:8081/construction/payloads'  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{
  "network_identifier": {
    "blockchain": "Internet Computer",
    "network": "00000000000000020101"
  },
  "public_keys": [
    {
      "hex_bytes": "047a83e378053f87b49aeae53b3ed274c8b2ffbe59d9a51e3c4d850ca8ac1684f7131b778317c0db04de661c7d08321d60c0507868af41fe3150d21b3c6c757367",
      "curve_type": "secp256k1"
    }
  ],
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation_identifier": {
        "index": 0
      },
      "type": "STAKE",
      "account": {
        "address": "8b84c3a3529d02a9decb5b1a27e7c8d886e17e07ea0a538269697ef09c2a27b4"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "neuron_index": 0
      }
    }
  ],
  "metadata": null
}'
```

When submitting the transaction the returned output will look something like the following.
```json
{'transaction_identifier': {'hash': '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'}, 'metadata': {'operations': [{'account': {'address': '8b84c3a3529d02a9decb5b1a27e7c8d886e17e07ea0a538269697ef09c2a27b4'}, 'metadata': {'neuron_id': 3094748712371737240, 'neuron_index': 0}, 'operation_identifier': {'index': 0}, 'status': 'COMPLETED', 'type': 'STAKE'}]}}
```
Let's look at the response. Neuron management operations don’t strictly adhere to the Rosetta specification. If the transaction only contains the neuron management operations (like the example above), the returned transaction hash won’t be on the ICP ledger chain. The returned transaction hash does not make any sense for governance operations and is thus left blank. 
The governance will take your public key and the neuron index provided (in this case it was 0) and either create a new `neuron_id` or add the ICP to an already existing neuron with the same derived `neuron_id`. In this case the neuron with the `neuron_id` `3094748712371737240` was created. 

:::info
The `neuron_id` is an internal representation of neurons on the governance canister. The neuron index corresponds to the index of neurons that a certain public key controlls. Taking the public key `047a83e378053f87b49aeae53b3ed274c8b2ffbe59d9a51e3c4d850ca8ac1684f7131b778317c0db04de661c7d08321d60c0507868af41fe3150d21b3c6c757367`, the index `0` and given how many existing neurons already exist,
the governance canister arrives at the `neuron_id` `3094748712371737240`
