# NNS Voting
This section will give you an overview of how how voting on the Neurons using Rosetta works. 
This guide assumes you are familiar with the [flow of operations](/docs/developer-docs/defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/construction_api/operations_flow/index.mdx). 
Futhermore, it assumes that you have a Rosetta instance running at: `http://127.0.0.1:8081`.
This tutorial also assumes that you are familiar with the concept of staking and voting on the NNS in general. To read up on how these concepts work on the Internet Computer Protocol
you can look at the [documentation of the NNS](/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/overview).
