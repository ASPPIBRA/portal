# Construction-API implementation
This section will give you an overview of how you can make transactions via Rosetta using the Construction-API
## Supported Transactions
The Construction-API allows for offline signing of transactions and then posting them on the IC at a later point in time. It is recommended to first go through [flow of operations](/docs/developer-docs/defi/rosetta/icp_rosetta/construction_api/operations_flow/index.md) of the Construction-API to gain an understanding of how it works, what endpoints to call with what parameters and where the user has to take action upon receiving certain responses.
