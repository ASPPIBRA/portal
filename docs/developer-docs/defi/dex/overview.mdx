# Decentralized exchange overview

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Concept"]} />

A decentralized exchange, or DEX, is a peer-to-peer marketplace where transactions are executed directly between parties. There is no central intermediary that executes the transaction, such as a bank, broker, or other institution. Each transaction is recorded directly on-chain. DEXs are primarily used to trade or swap cryptocurrencies.

## Centralized exchanges versus decentralized exchanges

A centralized exchange allows for fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies to be exchanged for one another. On a centralized exchange such as Coinbase, you can trade ICP for its worth in USD, then transfer that USD directly to your bank.

A decentralized exchange only allows for cryptocurrencies to be traded for other cryptocurrencies through crypto pairs. They may also support more advanced actions like limit orders and margin trades. Each transaction is handled by the decentralized exchange via an order book, which uses the current buy and sell orders for that token to establish the price. Decentralized exchanges use a set of smart contracts to establish the price of different cryptocurrencies against each other. They also use liquidity pools, where investors can facilitate trades by locking funds within an exchange in return for rewards.

## ICP decentralized exchanges

ICP enables decentralized exchanges and order books to run on-chain, utilizing ICP's cheap storage and computation. The DEX's internal balance and transactions can be stored in a canister, alongside user balances and data.

Some examples of DEXs running on ICP include:

- [Helix Markets](https://www.helixmarkets.io/)

- [ICPSwap](https://icpswap.com/)

- [ICDex](https://avjzx-pyaaa-aaaaj-aadmq-cai.raw.ic0.app/ICDex)

- [Sonic](https://sonic.ooo/)

## Interacting with a DEX

### DEX tools 

In addition to using DEX frontends directly, DEXes on ICP have also created utilities that enable developers to easily interact with their infrastructure:

- The [Helix SDK](https://github.com/Helix-ex/sdk) includes libraries in Rust, Python, and C# that enable [order book management](https://helix-ex.github.io/apidocs/docs/order-management/#order-management-api) such as making trades, depositing assets, and accessing [order book data](https://helix-ex.github.io/apidocs/docs/market-data/#market-data-api) on [Helix Markets](https://www.helixmarkets.io/).

- [ICPSwap](https://github.com/ICPSwap-Labs/docs) offers an API that allows developers to create staking pools, add liquidity, trade tokens, retrieve order book data, and more, directly on [ICPSwap](https://www.icpswap.com/).

Moreover, these DEXes have open-sourced their entire codebase:

- [ICDex](https://github.com/iclighthouse/ICDex)
- [Sonic](https://github.com/sonicdex/sonic-app)

### Examples of interacting with tokens using code

The following code samples provide examples of implementing a DEX on ICP. 

- The primary reference for this implementation is the DEX example for a DEX using DIP20 tokens on ICP in [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/defi) and [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/defi). 

:::info
Please note that DIP20 has been replaced by ICRC2 and is not recommended for the deployment of new tokens.
:::

- Swap and transfer ICRC1/ICRC2 tokens in [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/token_transfer) and [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/token_transfer)

- Transfer ICRC1 token on behalf of another account in [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/token_transfer_from) and [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/token_transfer_from)
