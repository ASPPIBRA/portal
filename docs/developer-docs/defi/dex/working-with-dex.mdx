# Working with a DEX

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate" , "Concept"]} />

This document provides an overview to working with a [decentralized exchange (DEX)](/overview) on ICP and interacting with the token mechanics of [ICP](docs/current/developer-docs/defi/tokens/token-standards#icp-tokens), the native token of the Internet Computer, and [ICRC1](/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/tokens/token-standards#icrc-1)/[ICRC2](/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/tokens/token-standards#icrc-2), the most recent fungible token standards.

## Using an existing DEX

DeFi users can interact with [ICP](docs/current/developer-docs/defi/tokens/token-standards#icp-tokens), [ICRC1](/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/tokens/token-standards#icrc-1)/[ICRC2](/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/tokens/token-standards#icrc-2) tokens, and tokens created using the older [DIP20](/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/tokens/token-standards#dip-20) standard via the frontend interfaces of major DEXes that support ICP. These include [Helix Markets](https://www.helixmarkets.io/), [ICPSwap](https://www.icpswap.com/), [ICLight](https://iclight.io/), and [Sonic](https://sonic.ooo/). 

In addition to using their frontends directly, they have also created utilities that enable developers to easily interact with their infrastructure:

- The [Helix SDK](https://github.com/Helix-ex/sdk) includes libraries in Rust, Python, and C# that enable [order book management](https://helix-ex.github.io/apidocs/docs/order-management/#order-management-api) such as making trades, depositing assets, and accessing [order book data](https://helix-ex.github.io/apidocs/docs/market-data/#market-data-api) on [Helix Markets](https://www.helixmarkets.io/).

- [ICPSwap](https://github.com/ICPSwap-Labs/docs) offers an API that allows developers to create staking pools, add liquidity, trade tokens, retrieve order book data, and more, directly on [ICPSwap](https://www.icpswap.com/).

Moreover, these DEXes have open-sourced their entire codebase:
- [ICPSwap](https://github.com/ICPSwap-Labs)
- [ICDex](https://github.com/iclighthouse/ICDex)
- [Sonic](https://github.com/sonicdex/sonic-app)

## Example with managing and interacting with tokens using code

The following code samples provide examples of implementing a DEX on ICP. 

- The primary reference for this implementation is the DEX example for a DEX using DIP20 tokens on ICP in [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/defi) and [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/defi). 

:::info
Please note that DIP20 has been replaced by ICRC2 and is not recommended for the deployment of new tokens.
:::

- Swap and transfer ICRC1/ICRC2 tokens in [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/token_transfer) and [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/token_transfer)

- Transfer ICRC1 token on behalf of another account in [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/token_transfer_from) and [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/token_transfer_from)
