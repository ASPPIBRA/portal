# Deploy

## Overview

After you have built a canister, you can deploy it either on the [local execution environment](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/deploy/local), a sandbox environment such as the [Motoko playground](/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/playground) or [on the mainnet](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/deploy/mainnet). Your canister must be deployed before you can make calls to it and execute methods. 

- #### Step 1:  Open a new terminal and navigate to your project directory.

- #### Step 2:  Start the local canister execution environment, if necessary.

```
dfx start
```

- #### Step 3:  Verify the canisters you'd like to deploy are configured in the project's `dfx.json` file.

An example `dfx.json` file can be found in the [default project template document](/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/first-canister)

- #### Step 4:  Deploy all of the canisters within your project.

To deploy locally, use the command:

```
dfx deploy 
```

To deploy to the [Motoko playground](/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/playground), use the command:

```
dfx deploy --playground
```

To deploy to the mainnet, use the command:

```
dfx deploy --network ic
```

Deploying canisters to the mainnet will cost cycles. [Learn more about cycles and how to acquire them](/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/cycles/cycles-faucet).

This command deploys all canisters configured in your `dfx.json` file. To deploy just one canister, specify the canister's name:

```
dfx deploy hello_backend ## Deploy locally
dfx deploy hello_backend --playground ## Deploy to the playground
dfx deploy hello_backend --network ic ## Deploy to the mainnet
```

These commands both deploy to the local network since they do not include a `--network` flag. 

For more information on deploying to the local or mainnet networks:

- [Local deployment](/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally).

- [Motoko playground](/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/playground).

- [Mainnet deployment](/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-mainnet).

## Use a custom Motoko version with `dfx deploy`

To use a custom Motoko version with `dfx deploy`, export the following environment variable that indicates which Motoko base version you'd like `dfx` to use:

```
DFX_MOC_PATH="$(vessel bin)/moc" dfx deploy
```

## Setting a canister's init arguments

You can set a canister's init arguments when the canister is deployed by passing the `--argument` flag in either the `dfx install` or `dfx deploy` commands:

```
dfx canister install <CANISTER_NAME> --argument "(arg in candid)"
```

```
dfx deploy <CANISTER_NAME> --argument "(arg in candid)"
```

If several arguments should be used, an argument file can be defined with the `--argument-file` flag instead:

```
dfx deploy <CANISTER_NAME> --argument-file file.txt
```

Alternatively, init arguments can be set in `dfx.json` in `dfx` versions `v0.17.0` and newer:

```json
"canisters": {
    "hello_backend": {
      "candid": "src/hello_backend/hello_backend.did",
      "package": "hello_backend",
      "type": "rust",
      "init_arg": "(arg in candid)"
    },
 }
```

If an init argument is set in `dfx.json` and set with the CLI command, the argument set in the CLI command is used.

## Setting tasks to execute once a canister has been deployed

For certain workflows, it may be important to have a canister execute a task or call as soon as the canister is deployed or started. For this workflow, using [timers](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/periodic-tasks) can be useful.

Here is an example:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="motoko" label="Motoko" default>

This example uses a global timer that gets called immediately after the canister starts:

```motoko

system func timer(setGlobalTimer : Nat64 -> ()) : async () {
  let next = Nat64.fromIntWrap(Time.now()) + 20_000_000_000;
  setGlobalTimer(next); // absolute time in nanoseconds
  print("Tick!");
}
```

You can learn more in the [Motoko Timer library documentation](/docs/current/motoko/main/base/Timer).

<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

This example creates a periodic timer that gets called immediately after the canister starts:

```rust
#[ic_cdk::init]
fn init(timer_interval_secs: u64) {
    let interval = std::time::Duration::from_secs(timer_interval_secs);
    ic_cdk::println!("Starting a periodic task with interval {interval:?}");
    ic_cdk_timers::set_timer_interval(interval, || {
        COUNTER.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
    });
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">

```typescript
import { Canister, Duration, ic, TimerId, Tuple, update } from 'azle';

export default Canister({
    setTimers: update([Duration], Tuple(TimerId, TimerId), (delay) => {
        const functionTimerId = ic.setTimer(delay, callback);

        const capturedValue = '';

        const closureTimerId = ic.setTimer(delay, () => {
            console.log(`closure called and captured value ${capturedValue}`);
        });

        return [functionTimerId, closureTimerId];
    })
});

function callback() {
    console.log('callback called');
}
```

</TabItem>

def timer_callback():
