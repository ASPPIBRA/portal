# Using ckERC20 tokens in dapps

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Ethereum" ]} />

## Overview

All ckERC20 tokens are ICRC-2 compliant tokens, which means that they support the [ICRC-1](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-1/README.md) and [ICRC-2](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-2/README.md) token standards.

To integrate ckERC20 tokens into your dapp, you can simply write code that uses the [ICRC-1](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-1/README.md) and [ICRC-2](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/blob/main/standards/ICRC-2/README.md) standards. For token transfers and account balances, requests must be sent to the corresponding ckERC20 ledger canister.

## Write a smart contract that uses ckERC20 tokens

The same code as provided for [ckBTC](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/chain-key-tokens/ckbtc/using-ckbtc-in-dapps#write-a-smart-contract-that-uses-ckbtc) and [ckETH](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/chain-key-tokens/cketh/using-cketh-in-dapps#write-a-smart-contract-that-uses-cketh) can be used, the only difference being the targeted ledger canister.
