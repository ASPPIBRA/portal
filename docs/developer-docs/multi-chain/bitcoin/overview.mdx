# Overview

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Bitcoin" ]} />

Smart contracts running on ICP can directly interact with the Bitcoin network without using bridges.
This is possible because ICP nodes can fetch and validate the Bitcoin network's blocks, and then make them available for smart contracts to query and read.
Smart contracts can also sign and send Bitcoin transactions, allowing them to directly hold BTC.

This direct Bitcoin integration is based on two features:

- **[Threshold ECDSA](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/encryption/t-ecdsa)**: A smart contract can have a secret key that is stored in a secure and decentralized way using chain-key cryptography. This key can be used to digitally sign messages. One of the supported signing algorithms, ECDSA is compatible with the Bitcoin blockchain, enabling smart contracts to sign Bitcoin transactions.

- **Bitcoin adapter**: ICP has one subnet whose nodes participate in the Bitcoin network. These nodes are used to fetch the Bitcoin state and blocks and send transactions to the network.

The diagram below shows the flow of interacting with the Bitcoin network from a smart contract.

## How it works

At the protocol-level, both the Bitcoin adapter and chain-key ECDSA features expose an API on the [management canister](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/advanced-features/management-canister).

When a canister wants to make a Bitcoin transaction, a request is sent to the Bitcoin subnet that hosts a Bitcoin canister that contains ICP's on-chain Bitcoin state. The request is sent to the Bitcoin network through the Bitcoin adapter and is processed by Bitcoin asynchronously.

## ckBTC

ICP implements a smart contract that uses threshold ECDSA and chain-key cryptography to provide a [**ckBTC**](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/bitcoin/ckbtc/overview) token (chain-key BTC) that is backed 1:1 by BTC.

The primary value of chain-key tokens, such as ckBTC, is that it can be transferred with the low finality time (within seconds) and for a fraction of the cost of a transaction on the token's native network (in this instance, a BTC transaction on Bitcoin).

## Use-cases and sample apps

Developers that need more advanced interaction with the Bitcoin network need to use the lower-level threshold ECDSA and Bitcoin APIs. An example of such an advanced use case would be working with Bitcoin inscriptions.

The threshold ECDSA API provides a way for smart contracts to sign transactions with their secret keys. The Bitcoin API allows smart contracts to read the Bitcoin state (UTXOs and balances) and send signed transactions.

The ckBTC token is suitable for the common use cases of holding, transferring, and trading BTC.

Sample apps:

- Crowdfunding platforms that accept BTC such as [Funded](https://funded.app/).

- Social applications that support sending crypto to other users, like [OpenChat](https://oc.app/).

- Online eCommerce platforms. [Bitshop](https://ughim-6qaaa-aaaah-qc7qa-cai.ic0.app/) is one example.

- [Mobile payments](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foo.arth&pli=1).
