# Understanding ICP for Bitcoin developers

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Bitcoin"]} />

## Overview
This guide is designed to help Bitcoin developers understand the core concepts of ICP for using ICP as a Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin and as a separate blockchain.

### Smart contracts

Bitcoinâ€™s scripting language, Script, is fairly simple, which makes complex smart contracts rather difficult to deploy directly on the base layer. 

Bitcoin developers who are looking to build more complex smart contracts will need to build on a Bitcoin smart contract layer such as ICP, each offering its unique set of developer tools. 

Canister smart contracts on ICP have special properties that allow developers to develop scalable services. Canister smart contracts can be written in any language that complies to WASM including [Rust](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/), [Typescript](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/Typescript), [Motoko](/docs/current/motoko/main/getting-started/motoko-introduction), and [Python](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/python/). This further allows for greater complexity in smart contract development. 

To learn more about full canister smart contract functionality, refer to the [Smart Contracts documentation](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/overview/introduction).

Specifically, through protocol-level integration of ICP with the [Bitcoin network](docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/bitcoin/overview), ICP smart contracts can interact with the Bitcoin network directly. Canister smart contracts can run [queries against the full Bitcoin UTXO](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/bitcoin/using-btc/read-state) set including finding the balance of any Bitcoin address. They can [hold](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/bitcoin/using-btc/generate-addresses), [sign](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/bitcoin/using-btc/sign-transactions), and [submit transactions](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/bitcoin/using-btc/submit-transactions) to the Bitcoin network. 

To learn more about the Bitcoin integration on ICP, refer to the [Bitcoin integration documentation](docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/bitcoin/overview).

Additionally, the upcoming [Threshold Schnorr integration](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/threshold-schnorr-facilitating-brc-20-trading-solana-integration-certificate-signing-and-more/28993) will allow developers to interact with Runes and Ordinals directly in canister smart contracts. A [Schnorr canister example](https://github.com/domwoe/schnorr_canister/) is available as a preview of this integration.

ICP uses different terminology for concepts similar to those in Bitcoin. This table summarizes the key terminology differences between Bitcoin and ICP:

<thead>
<tr>
  <th> Bitcoin term </th>
  <th> ICP term </th>

  <td> Smart contract </td>
  <td> Canister </td>

  <td> Gas </td>
  <td> Cycles </td>

  <td> Account </td>

In addition, ICP has implemented similar token standards as Bitcoin:

  <td> BRC-20 </td>
  <td> [ICRC-1/ICRC-2](../../../../references/icrc1-standard) </td>

<tr>
  <td> BRC-721 </td>
  <td> [ICRC-7](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC/blob/icrc7-wg-draft/ICRCs/ICRC-7/ICRC-7.md) </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Consensus
Bitcoin uses Proof of Work as its consensus mechanism.

The IC consensus protocol provides cryptographically guaranteed finality. The approach on ICP avoids the drawbacks of probabilistic finality used in Bitcoin-like protocols, which include the weak notion and increased time to finality. The consensus mechanism of ICP ensures faster and more secure transaction finality.
