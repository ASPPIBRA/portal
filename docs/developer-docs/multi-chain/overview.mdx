# Overview

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Multi-chain", "Concept" ]} />

## What is multi-chain?

The term 'multi-chain' refers to the Internet Computer's ability to trustlessly make direct calls to another blockchain, enabling dapps to expand their capabilities across multiple networks. ICP smart contracts can interact with another chain's smart contracts and process the chain's native assets. This ability to communicate directly with other blockchain networks is possible using the protocol's unique cryptography features, which support signing transactions that execute on other networks. ICP currently has multi-chain integrations with the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.

Traditionally, for one blockchain to communicate in this manner with other chains, they need to use a blockchain 'bridge'. Traditional bridges introduce several problems:

- The bridge is an intermediary service that must be trusted to handle transactions and assets honestly and properly.

- Bridges can be subjects of security vulnerabilities and exploits.

- Transaction times have a high amount of latency.

- Bridges do not meet regulatory standards.

On ICP, there is no bridge, hub, or other intermediary â€” just two chains communicating directly.

## How multi-chain on ICP works

Multi-chain is possible through unique features of ICP: [threshold ECDSA signatures](/docs/current/references/t-ecdsa-how-it-works), chain-key cryptography, and [HTTPS outcalls](/docs/current/references/https-outcalls-how-it-works).

Threshold ECDSA signatures, combined with chain-key cryptography, allow ICP smart contracts to create [signed transactions](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/encryption/signing-transactions) on other networks. By submitting transactions directly to other chains, ICP dapps can interact directly with another chain's smart contracts, assets, and tokens.

HTTPS outcalls are used to communicate with external entities, and are used by the EVM RPC canister, allowing smart contracts to interact with JSON-RPC services for EVM-compatible chains, not only Ethereum.

Integrations with different chains vary in how they utilize these features to facilitate the integration.

### Bitcoin integration

The integration with Bitcoin primarily uses the threshold ECDSA feature along with a Bitcoin adapter. Threshold ECDSA is used to securely store a smart contract's secret key, which is used to sign transactions. Bitcoin supports ECDSA, allowing ICP smart contracts to directly create and sign transactions on the Bitcoin network. Canisters can also create a Bitcoin address, then send and receive bitcoin as if they were a traditional Bitcoin user.

The Bitcoin adapter is a subnet of nodes that participate in the Bitcoin network. They fetch the Bitcoin network state and blocks, then facilitate sending transactions to the Bitcoin network.

### Ethereum integration

The integration with Ethereum also uses threshold ECDSA for canisters to create and sign transactions directly on the Ethereum network. However, instead of an adapter like the Bitcoin integration uses, the Ethereum integration uses a full-node API that utilizes HTTPS outcalls to query information from the Ethereum network and submit transactions. This API can be used through the [EVM RPC canister](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/ethereum/evm-rpc). The EVM RPC canister supports several RPC services, such as CloudFlare, Ankr, BlockPI, and Alchemy.

## Benefits of multi-chain

When compared to traditional blockchain bridges, ICP's multi-chain capabilities have several benefits:

- **Enhanced programmability**: Dapps can expand their functionalities and capabilities beyond just ICP, allowing for new use-cases and applications.

- **Orchestration**: Transactions on integrated networks can be orchestrated and automated using ICP smart contracts.

- **Security and privacy**: ICP's direct integration with other chains is more secure than using an intermediary blockchain bridge, which may have security vulnerabilities and be exploited.

- **Lower transaction costs**: Submitting transactions to Bitcoin or Ethereum from an ICP smart contract have a significantly lower cost than submitting transactions on the chains directly.

- **Faster transaction times**: Transaction times on Bitcoin and Ethereum are drastically reduced by using the ICP multi-chain integrations for each.

## Multi-chain integrations

Current multi-chain integrations include Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the EVM RPC canister can be used to interact with any EVM-compatible chain, such as Polygon or Avalanche.  Direct integration with other chains is possible, and developers can build their own.

## Multi-chain tokens

ICP supports multi-chain tokens that are created using chain-key cryptography. These tokens are digital twins of their corresponding native token and are backed 1:1 by their native token. that is held 100% on-chain on ICP. For example, ckBTC is the digital twin of BTC, and ckETH is the digital twin of ETH.

Chain-key tokens are different from traditional wrapped tokens. Chain-key tokens use advanced cryptography to create an identical corresponding token with the same properties and valuation, but hosted on ICP. Traditional wrapped tokens use underlying assets with different properties.

Chain-key tokens don't use blockchain bridges, intermediaries, or centralized entities. All chain-key operations are performed on-chain. They also have a faster finality time and a cheaper transaction cost than wrapped tokens typically have.

Currently supported multi-chain tokens include:

- [ckBTC](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/bitcoin/ckbtc)

- [ckETH](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/ethereum/cketh)

In the future, chain-key tokens are planned for:

- ckERC-20

- ckUSDT

- ckUSDC

## Multi-chain wallets

To hold multi-chain assets such as ckBTC and ckETH, you will need to use a wallet that supports multi-chain assets. Multi-chain wallets that can be used include:

- [NNS dapp](/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/nns-app-quickstart#add-an-account)

- [Oisy wallet](https://oisy.com/)
