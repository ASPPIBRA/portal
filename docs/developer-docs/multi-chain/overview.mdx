# Overview

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Multi-chain", "Concept" ]} />

## What is multi-chain?

The term 'multi-chain' refers to the Internet Computer's ability to trustlessly make direct calls to another blockchain, enabling dapps to expand their capabilities across multiple networks. ICP smart contracts can interact with another chain's smart contracts and native assets. Multi-chain introduces the decentralized custody of assets. Smart contracts can have multiple addresses for receving and holding assets of other chains. 

By interacting with assets on other chains, smart contracts can unleash new possibilities by tapping into the fast finality, low costs and reverse gas model of the IC, while still preserving the highest degree of security. This ability to communicate directly with other blockchain networks is possible using the protocol's unique cryptography features, which support decentralized signing of transactions that natively execute on other networks. ICP currently has multi-chain integrations with the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.

Traditionally, for one blockchain to communicate in this manner with other chains, they need to use a blockchain 'bridge'. Traditional bridges introduce several problems:

- The bridge is an intermediary service that must be trusted to handle transactions and assets honestly and properly.

- Bridges can be subjects of security vulnerabilities and exploits.

- Transaction times have a high amount of latency.

- Bridges do not meet regulatory standards.

On ICP, there are no bridges, hubs, or other intermediaries â€” just two chains communicating directly. 

When interacting with bridges and multiple chains, there are often additional services and dependencies that must be managed as well. With ICP, there aren't any extra services to manage thanks to ICP's autonomous design. 

## How multi-chain on ICP works

Multi-chain is possible through the unique features of ICP: [threshold ECDSA signatures](/docs/current/references/t-ecdsa-how-it-works), [chain-key cryptography](https://internetcomputer.org/how-it-works/chain-key-technology), and [HTTPS outcalls](/docs/current/references/https-outcalls-how-it-works).

Threshold ECDSA signatures, combined with chain-key cryptography, allow ICP smart contracts to create [signed transactions](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/encryption/signing-transactions) that are submitted on other networks to be executed. By submitting transactions directly to other chains, ICP dapps can interact directly with another chain's smart contracts, assets, and tokens.

HTTPS outcalls are used to communicate with external entities, and are used by the EVM RPC canister, allowing smart contracts to interact with JSON-RPC services for EVM-compatible chains.

Integrations with different chains vary in how they utilize these features to facilitate the integration.

### Bitcoin integration

The integration with Bitcoin primarily uses the threshold ECDSA signing service along with a Bitcoin adapter. The threshold ECDSA signing service is facilitated by a special large subnet, where each node securely stores a share of the subnet's secret key. To create a signature, the nodes of this subnet need to collaborate with each other. Canisters can then request ECDSA signatures from this signing service in order to create valid transactions for other chains. This way they don't need to own their own secret key. Since Bitcoin supports ECDSA signatures, the ICP smart contracts are able to directly create, sign  and submit transactions to the Bitcoin network. Each canisters has an individual Bitcoin address, which can be used to send and receive bitcoin as if they were a traditional Bitcoin user.

 ICP nodes have a special extension called the Bitcoin adapter allowing them to directly fetch the Bitcoin network state and blocks, then facilitate sending transactions to the Bitcoin network.

### Ethereum integration

The integration with Ethereum also uses threshold ECDSA for canisters to create and sign transactions directly on the Ethereum network. However, instead of an adapter like the Bitcoin integration uses, the Ethereum integration uses a full-node API that utilizes HTTPS outcalls to query information from the Ethereum network and submit transactions. This API can be used through the [EVM RPC canister](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/ethereum/evm-rpc). The EVM RPC canister supports several RPC services, such as CloudFlare, Ankr, BlockPI, and Alchemy.

## Benefits of multi-chain

When compared to traditional blockchain bridges, ICP's multi-chain capabilities have several benefits:

- **Enhanced programmability**: Dapps can expand their functionalities and capabilities beyond just ICP, allowing for new use-cases and applications.

- **Orchestration**: Transactions on integrated networks can be orchestrated and automated using ICP smart contracts.

- **Security and privacy**: ICP's direct integration with other chains is more secure than using an intermediary blockchain bridge, which may have security vulnerabilities and be exploited.

- **Lower transaction costs**: Submitting transactions to Bitcoin or Ethereum from an ICP smart contract have a significantly lower cost than submitting transactions on the chains directly.

- **Faster transaction times**: Transaction times on Bitcoin and Ethereum are drastically reduced by using the ICP multi-chain integrations for each.

## Multi-chain integrations

Current multi-chain integrations include Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the EVM RPC canister can be used to interact with any EVM-compatible chain, such as Arbitrum or Avalanche.  Direct integration with other chains is possible, and developers can build their own.

## Multi-chain tokens

ICP supports multi-chain tokens that are created using chain-key cryptography. These tokens are digital twins of their corresponding native token and are backed 1:1 by their native token. For example, ckBTC is the digital twin of BTC, and ckETH is the digital twin of ETH. The backing native assets are managed 100% on-chain by decentralized canisters without any intermediaries.

Chain-key tokens are different from traditional wrapped tokens. While both create an identical corresponding token with the same properties and valuation, the main difference with wrapped tokens is in the redemption guarantees into the native tokens. The management of native assets and conversion from the chain-key token into the native token happens in a fully trustless manner and is based upon an advanced cryptography. While the traditional wrapped tokens usually rely on centralized pieces of infrastructure (bridges) connecting two chains which is inherently less secure.

Chain-key tokens don't use blockchain bridges, intermediaries, or centralized entities. All chain-key operations are performed on-chain. They also have a faster finality time and a cheaper transaction cost than wrapped tokens typically have.

Currently supported multi-chain tokens include:

- [ckBTC](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/bitcoin/ckbtc)

- [ckETH](/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/ethereum/cketh)

In the future, chain-key tokens are planned for other ERC20 twins.

## Multi-chain wallets

To hold multi-chain assets such as ckBTC and ckETH, you will need to use a wallet that supports multi-chain assets. Multi-chain wallets that can be used include:

- [NNS dapp](/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/nns-app-quickstart#add-an-account)

- [Oisy wallet](https://oisy.com/)

- [Astro ME](https://astrox.me/)

- [Plug](https://plugwallet.ooo/)
